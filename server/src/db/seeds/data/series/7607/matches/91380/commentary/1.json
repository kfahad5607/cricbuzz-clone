But enter Jadeja and the game changed on its head. Three quick wickets and the pitch too changed dramatically. It aided the spinners and Mustafizur too resorted to bowling fast offspin at the end. The slower balls did not come on, made stroke-making extremely difficult and KKR just couldn't get to grips with the pitch. Batters came and went and no-one was able to get the big hits going. At one stage KKR even had Manish Pandey ready to come in as the impact sub. Shreyas Iyer nudged his way to 34 off 32 and it is advantage CSK at the moment. But KKR have two excellent spinners in Narine and Chakaravarthy and they will feel they can still make a match out of this. Back for the reply in 5 minutes...</p>",
