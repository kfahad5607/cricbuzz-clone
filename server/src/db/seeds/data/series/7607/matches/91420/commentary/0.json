    "commText": "<p><b>Preview</b> by <b>Aayush Puthran</b> \\n \\nWhen Sunil Narine, the batter does well, Kolkata Knight Riders, the team does well. His performance as a pinch-hitter has been an anomaly in the Indian Premier League. Let alone finding success in that role, very few teams have even ventured into replicating that plan with their options. \\n \\nNarine's pinch-hitting proved to be a success for a few seasons before his weakness against fast and short deliveries was exploited and he became a liability at the top. But in 2024, he returned with an improved version of his batting and cracked open the game for his side with some explosive hits at the top. Heading into his sixth game of the season, not only does he boast of the most runs (127) and highest strike rate (201.59) among all players in the powerplay this season, but has also ensured that his team has been the most productive when the field restrictions are on (averaging 54.4 at a run-rate of 11.33), significantly ahead of the second best team - Mumbai Indians. \\n \\nHis exploits have also ensured that it has covered up for the otherwise average showing of his opening partner, Phil Salt. Nonetheless, team mentor Gautam Gambhir isn't fretting over the English batter's performances as yet. \"It's a team game,\" he insists and adds that as far as the team is doing well, individual performances can be overlooked. It's a similar defence he offers for another of their overseas players, Mitchell Starc, who is yet to make an impact this season, after having garnered never-seen-before interest at the auction. \\n \\nThe Indian domestic pacers, Harshit Rana and Vaibhav Arora have offered ample support to the spinners to cover up for Starc, but they would still hope for their big auction buy to come good sooner rather than later. As they return to Eden Gardens after a six-day break and 22 days away from their home venue, they would hope to mark the Bengali New Year with a win for the home fans and also gather momentum in the three-game home stretch. \\n \\nUp against them first are the wounded Lucknow Super Giants, who have blown hot and cold, and looking to find momentum in the absence of Mayank Yadav. It's a side that has never lost to KKR. But the KL Rahul-led side has seen many firsts this season, the latest of those being their inability to defend a 160-plus total against Delhi Capitals in the previous game. \\n \\nHaving spent the last couple of years in their camp before his 'homecoming' this year, Gambhir knows a bit about what makes them tick, but he doesn't want to delve too much into the past. It's Poila Baisakh and he's hoping for a fresh start. \\n \\n<b>When:</b> Sunday, April 14, 2024, 3:30 PM IST \\n \\n<b>Where:</b> Kolkata Knight Riders vs Lucknow Super Giants, IPL 2024, Eden Gardens, Kolkata \\n \\n<b>What to expect:</b> It's Kolkata's first afternoon game of the season. It's going to be extremely hot and extremely humid. With no possibility of dew to play a part, the winning team might opt to bat first. Eden Gardens has been the second most high-scoring venue (where a minimum of three games have been played) since IPL 2023. So expect a lot of runs. \\n \\n<b>Head to head:</b> KKR 0-3 LSG. While LSG may have won all three of their games (batting first all three times), the margin of victory has reduced with each passing match \\n \\n<b>Team Watch:</b> \\n \\n<b>Kolkata Knight Riders:</b> \\n \\n<b>Injuries/Unavailability:</b> Gambhir had stated that Harshit Rana was fully fit ahead of the previous game, but he didn't feature in that match. Nitish Rana was also at practice. Apart from that, there are no injury concerns \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> LSG's top order batters - Quinton de Kock, Ayush Badoni and Devdutt Padikkal - have struggled against left-arm pacers, averaging 15.5, 11 and 8 respectively since IPL 2023. Could be a good time to give a long spell to Starc upfront. De Kock has also struggled to get going against the spin duo of Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy. The two could also be handy options in the powerplay. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Sunil Narine, Phil Salt, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Shreyas Iyer, Nitish Rana/Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Mitchell Starc, Harshit Rana/Vaibhav Arora, Varun Chakravarthy [Impact Sub: Suyash Sharma] \\n \\n<b>Lucknow Super Giants:</b> \\n \\n<b>Injuries/Unavailability:</b> The pace duo of Mayank Yadav and Mohsin Khan are yet to recover from their respective injuries. \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> Ravi Bishnoi is one of the very few bowlers to have kept Rinku Singh and Andre Russell reasonably quiet in the death overs. The leggie has not only dismissed both the batters once each, but they have also scored runs at a strike rate of only 116.7 and 133.33 respectively against him. Bishnoi could come in handy in the death overs. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> KL Rahul, Quinton de Kock, Deepak Hooda, Marcus Stoinis, Ayush Badoni, Nicholas Pooran, Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, Arshad Khan, Naveen-ul-Haq/Shamar Joseph, Yash Thakur [Impact Sub: M Siddharth/Devdutt Padikkal] \\n \\n<b>Did you know?</b> \\n \\nAmong venues that have hosted at least three matches since the start of IPL 2022, Eden Gardens has the highest scoring rate (9.64). The average first innings total is 195, second only to Mohali's 198, with five 200+ first innings totals in 10 games. \\n \\nKKR have lost the fewest wickets (5), has the highest average (54.40) and has the best RR (11.33) in the powerplay \\n \\nIn the match against RCB, Nicholas Pooran completed his 100th six in IPL and his balls/six ratio of 8.6 is bettered only by Andre Russell who hits one every 6.7 balls. \\n \\n<b>What they said:</b> \\n \\nThere's no reason why you should talk about individual performance. I feel that Mitchell Starc has done reasonably okay. I think he's bowled some tough overs. And he will create an impact, what he's been picked for - Gautam Gambhir, KKR mentor \\n \\nHe (Mayank Yadav) is feeling good, he looks good, but we don't want to rush him. We need to protect his body, he's itching to go. Need to make sure that he's hundred percent (fit) before he comes back - KL Rahul, LSG skipper</p>",
