DC will look back at the scorecard and will think they'd too many batters who got a start and didn't convert it into a bigger score. Shai Hope was the top-scorer with 33, but it needed impact substitute Abishek Porel's last over onslaught to get them to a good total. PBKS were very disciplined with the ball and were backed well in the field - Two wickets each for Arshdeep and Harshal, though the latter's last over became the difference between chasing 155 and chasing 175 now. Can DC take the momentum into their bowling? They've used up their impact substitution and might be a bowler short. Back for the chase shortly..</p>",
