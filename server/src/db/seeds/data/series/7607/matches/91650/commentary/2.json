Just the freeness of it. When we were batting out there, we didn't have any targets in mind. Were just maximising the opportunities in front of us. We have a good camaraderie between us. Even last year we batted a lot together. Lot of fun batting with him. In terms of numbers, definitely it is (best opening partnership for GT). Mohit bhai has done this for us the last couple of years. Even last year, his bowling was a revelation. Even this year, two three bad games can happen to anyone. At one point we thought 250 was there for the taking. In the last 2-3 overs they bowled well also. Just had a feeling we were 10-15 short - not in terms of the match but in terms of the NRR going forward.</p>",

Rahane only looking to dab this. Looked his partner for a run and Rachin responded. Miller swooped in on the ball from backward point and underarmed the ball with a direct-hit. He had a great chance on a good pitch to return to form but it's a misjudgement that's cost him bad. <b>Ravindra run out (Miller) 1(2)</b> </p>",
