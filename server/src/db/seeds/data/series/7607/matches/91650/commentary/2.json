Should've probably got a few more in the final few overs, but it didn't matter in the end. CSK got off to a terrible start in the chase, losing three wickets in the first three overs. It took an excellent partnership between Mitchell and Moeen - CSK's highest of the season - to keep them in the hunt, but a cracking spell from Mohit Sharma sealed the deal for GT. This result keeps them alive, and also gives a boost to a few other teams in the race for the playoffs.</p>",

Even last year we batted a lot together. Lot of fun batting with him. In terms of numbers, definitely it is (best opening partnership for GT).
