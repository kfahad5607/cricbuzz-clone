Head had a massive tailwind to start off and scored a ton off 39 balls. Klaasen at 3 carried on like he does and Samad blasted a 10-ball 37. RCB were out-batted. Faf and Kohli came out all guns blazing. But Kohli fell and that opened the door for a collapse as Markande and Cummins ate up the top-order. Both of them were superb on a wicket which had nothing in it for the bowlers. But RCB finished with 262 as DK came up with some lusty exhibtion of big innovative hitting. He timed the ball like a dream but didn't have much support from the other end. RCB have now lost 5 on the bounce. They are languishing at the bottom of the table.

It was good to see the fight, 30-40 runs from the bowling perspective was a bit too much. It's important to go away and freshen your mind, it's such a mental game.

The MCS is known to be a batting turf. But it was a dream today for the batters and few of them sleep-walked a few runs on it. The bowlers just went for a hiding as four of the RCB bowlers conceded more than 50 runs. The word hapless defined RCB's bowling effort and their position on the points table. SRH have 8 points from 6 games now. They will continue to climb up given their artillery with the bat. Our artillery is almost out of stock. We will restock them and come back tomorrow.
