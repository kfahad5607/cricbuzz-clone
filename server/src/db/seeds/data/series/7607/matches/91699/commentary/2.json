They finish right at the bottom of the table and it's the second time that's happened in three years now. They had a pretty good opportunity of giving their fans something to cheer about tonight but it wasn't to be. As for LSG, not the ideal campaign for them either. They never really picked up steam and will brood over the 'what-ifs' as they miss out on qualification quite narrowly. So, that leaves looking forward to the much anticipated clash between RCB and CSK tomorrow. For now, this is <b>Anurag Hegde, Sagar Chawla and Praveen Kumar</b> bidding you goodbye.</p>",

Coming into the season I knew what my game would be. I have been inconsistent as well, I'd be fair to myself, so wanted to get some experience and make it count. Finishing the innings has been challenging sometimes especially in Lucknow. I have been\u00a0practising for a number of years and it's about\u00a0putting together all the experience and make it count. I have batted at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 but if I had to choose I like the powerplay. I can't be selfish and choose, the beauty of my batting is I can bat at any position and that's my strength. I'm just blessed I have a second chance to play this game again. Back then 8 years ago when I had an accident I thought\u00a0I will enjoy the game, take every chance I get and grateful that teams supported me and backed me and it's my job to repay them. [thoughts moving now to the World Cup] It's definitely gonna move there. It's at home and we are looking forward to it. The last couple of\u00a0years have been difficult for the men from the Caribbean and we are all looking forward to doing something special for the people back home.</p>",

Couple of injuries - happens to every team. We didn't play well enough collectively. Today was a really good performance. This is the kind of game we wanted to play more. Unfortunately we didn't do that. Really happy for them. Franchise has invested a lot of time and energy with them (Indian pacers in LSG). It's not just two months in the year. We sent Mayank and Yudhvir to South Africa to train with Morne Morkel. Hard work for them has paid off, but franchise and the team has worked a lot with them. I'm not sure. There's not much T20 cricket coming up now. It's been a season where I've learnt a lot about my own batting and what I need to do to get back in the team. Maybe middle-order, maybe not. We would've ideally wanted him (Pooran) to bat higher, but with how the team's lined up, we want our senior international players bat in positions where they can absorb pressure. Didn't want our two overseas batters to bat close together. I'm on my father-in-law's team now. We'll both be cheering for Sharma ji ka beta in the World Cup.</p>",

Rohit was in full flow tonight and the openers shared an 88-run stand which included an awkward rain interruption. Brevis was the first to fall and that triggered a collapse of sorts. SKY went for a duck and Rohit, who was looking good for a big score, fell for a well-made 68. They were suddenly strangled for runs as the LSG spinners kept things very tight and that brought more wickets. They completely lost their way through the middle before Naman Dhir came out and played a catchy knock.
