I feel whichever team plays the best, they got a great chance to win. They were going at great guns in the first 6 overs, and to bounce back from that situation it was nice to see. I wasn't thinking about stats or records, the weather wasn't great but we won the game and that's what is more important. It's all about understanding which bowler is doing well on that particular day, I feel both of them bowled well and my gut went with Varun (on bowling the 4th over) at that point and I backed him.</p>",

Tilak tried his best, but there was just too much to do at the end despite a breezy 6-ball 17 cameo from Dhir.
