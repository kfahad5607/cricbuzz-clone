But the way the batters took the responsibility it was fantastic. Absolutely he did. The game is changing and we all have to be flexible. It was earlier about 11 players, now it's about 15 players. Sanga and I had 4-5 chats around the 13th-17th over. But what Riyan did in that 20th over made it easy. It is all about gauging in which zone they are, you have to look at that and take the decision accordingly. Sandy was calm and Avesh as well and I took that call. Riyan has been a big name for the last 3-4 years, everywhere I go, in Kerala they ask me, when is he going to come good? touchwood, this is the season.

Warner fell for 49 and Pant soon after. The Impact Player Porel did not contribute much and even though Tristan Stubbs tried some late heroics, Sandeep Sharma and Avesh Khan kept their nerves to take RR home. The wicket got slower as the game went on and RR were well-led by Samson who handled his bowling changes nicely. Two each for Burger and Chahal and fine death bowling from Sandeep and Avesh.
