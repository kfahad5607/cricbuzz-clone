Shreyas Iyer elected to bat first on a proper highway of a track and his batters repaid the faith he had in them. Records were broken in galore as the visitors completely bossed the proceedings. Narine's free-flowing batting, young Raghuvanshi's classy knock, and quickfire cameos from Russell and Rinku Singh enabled KKR to post their highest score ever. It was always going to be an uphill task for DC and they were found wanting within the powerplay itself. They were reduced to 33/4 and from then on, the writing was on the wall for them. Pant and Stubbs lit up the stadium with their attractive strokeplay and stitched a 93-run stand. Once that was broken, DC kept losing wickets in clusters and crumbled under pressure. Starc picked his first two wickets of IPL 2024, Arora impressed with his 3-fer, and Chakravarthy also picked three. In the hindsight, DC didn't make judicious use of DRS and that added to their woes - one of them was that of Narine who went on to dismantle the DC bowlers with his highest T20 score!
