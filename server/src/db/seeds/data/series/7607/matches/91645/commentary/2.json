There were several dropped catches by the PBKS fielders and RCB batters made them pay for those dropped chances. Patidar notched up a brisk fifty, while Kohli smashed 92. In reply, Bairstow and Rossouw had a brisk partnership in the powerplay, however, once that partnership was broken, wickets kept tumbling for the rest of the innings. There were a couple of handy knocks by PBKS batters thereafter but it was a collective effort by the RCB bowlers that gave them an emphatic 60-run victory. Stay around for the presentations..</p>",

    "commText": "<p><b>Virat Kohli | Player of the Match:</b> For me it\u2019s still quality over quantity, more so now at this stage of my career. Me being 35, heading into 36 - for me quality over quantity works really well. The understanding of the game for so many years allows you to practice less but still stay mentally switched on, that\u2019s something I try to replicate in every practice session I go through. And some added challenges in terms of improving your own game, certain aspects of the game you want to get better at. It\u2019s an ever-evolving process, <b>I am certainly not a guy who wants to sit around saying this is the way I play and not improve on things I need to.</b> I brought out the slog-sweep to the spinners. I just mentally put myself in that situation, never practiced it at all. I know I can hit it (slog-sweep) because I have hit it in the past. I need to take a bit more risks. That\u2019s allowing me to hit that shot off the back foot as well. I have tried to expose that side of the field as well, which for me has been a massive factor in this IPL. I think it needs a bit more conviction to take out that thought, what if I get out. I am managing to stay ahead of that thought in this IPL and that is really helping me in the middle overs to keep the strike rate up and keeping the scoring rate going for the team as well. The only way to go through a long tournament is to absolutely be honest with yourselves. We were just not good enough in the first half of the tournament, precisely why we are in a situation again where so many factors after we win two games still have to go our way. Not an ideal scenario to be a part of, especially when we have won the second game of the season and we had those losses on the trot. Couple of close games, but still we were outplayed in most of those games (earlier in the tournament.) We just had a honest chat in the changing room that\u2019s not good enough. Playing at this level we need to pull up our socks and need to be more brave with the ball and bat. I think the starting point was Kolkata where we came out and bowled that way in the powerplay, kept hunting for wickets and that game went down to the wire. That gave us more belief that this is the kind of cricket we want to play. It came to a point where we were like you know what, don\u2019t look at the table and play for self respect. We as cricketers have gone through such hardships and such a long journey to be at this level, so we can\u2019t go out there and play in a way that doesn\u2019t make yourselves proud and the fans as well. They turn out in huge numbers and we can\u2019t keep disappointing them like this. So need to raise our level and play for our own pride as a team. The confidence came back, now we are on a roll but again you think what if this momentum had caught up just a week before, we wouldn\u2019t have been in a position where we have to depend on so many factors.</p>",
