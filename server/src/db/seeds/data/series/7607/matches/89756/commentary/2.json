Their spinners bowled well (in the middle overs), good decision by them to bowl first. With the dew batting got easier. Virat was playing well at the back end, with someone like Green coming in, you want to maximise those last overs. We tried to squeeze as hard as we can, but it was tricky to hit against the spinners. It was easier to hit the seamers. The pitch definitely got better, you could feel it, the ball was skidding along nicely. We were excellent in the first four overs. I think that 20 runs over (from Dagar) took the momentum away and shifted the pressure back on us. Not bowling Maxwell was because all right-handers were batting, so went to the left-handed spinner initially. With two right-handers at the crease, went to the left arm spinner and later got the leg spinner (Himanshu Sharma) into the attack. There was no point of being defensive, we needed wickets. When we got Jaiswal out, I didn't feel the need to go to Maxwell. Fielding was average, it's something we have spoken about, we'll work and try to improve. Not worried about catches, it's about showing intensity on the field.</p>",

This was as easy a chase as anything you might have seen in this format. Jaiswal went for a duck but then it was the Samson and Buttler show. They started off by attacking Dagar in the last over of the powerplay - that over set the tone and from there RR never looked back. Every over had a boundary when Samson and Buttler were going. The RR skipper went and a couple of cheap wickets followed. At the end the main interest was whether Buttler would get to a 100. Hetmyer's boundary in the penultimate over made it difficult but Buttler completed the job to end it in a blaze of glory. The wicket played better in the 2nd innings but it was the same old story for RCB. Their bowling lacked penetration and except Topley the others looked ordinary. Faf did not use Maxwell again, maybe considering the matchup against two right-handers in Samson and Buttler. The likes of Dagar and Himanshu barely made an impression. Familiar woes for RCB who slip to another loss. RR meanwhile remain unbeaten. Stay tuned for the presentation...</p>",
