Salt at the top ensured that the game was half-complete with his blistering assault. That innings set KKR on the way and despite DC pulling things back with three wickets, the two Iyers took their side home. KKR could have won earlier but the Iyers batted sensibly after three losses and did not give DC any chance to come back into the game. A totally different game this to the one that PBKS chased down 261 here last time but DC threw away their wickets and a bit more discipline shown could have given them more runs.

After the powerplay the pitch started helping the spinners, was tacky. We got a fair idea as to how it played and to tackle the tackiness. Narine still does not attend those meetings but Salt is always there, gives\u00a0us his inputs and it's pure bliss to see him coming up and doing all this. [if Narine attends meetings] He doesn't. I would not recommend him to come either. [on Chakaravarthy] he has not been at his best the last few games. He has been assessing the wicket and has been giving us inputs. The way he turned up today was simply brilliant. [qualification] We have always been looking at it, even from the first game. The mindset is to qualify as early as possible. Just work on our work ethic and processes, don't want to look at the points table.</p>",

[on him having a good match-up against Pant] Nothing like that, when the catch was dropped, I felt that was a better ball, and the one I got him, on other grounds, it would\u00a0have gone for a six. Cricket has become a game of fine margins. I liked Tristan Stubbs' wicket. I planned to bowl the legspinner to him and it worked out. [on conversations between him and Narine] Silence. When something doesn't work\u00a0for me, he is always there. In the last game after conceding so many runs, it was a tough pill to take but the whole team motivated us. Abhishek Nayar and even Shahrukh Khan came and spoke to me, definitely motivated us. [on the cheerleaders dancing] They should start dancing only for the sixers and not for the fours.</p>",
