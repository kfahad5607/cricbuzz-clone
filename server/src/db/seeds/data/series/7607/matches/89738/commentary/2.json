That's such a rare and a great sight to see especially in this format where the bowlers are mere cannon fodder on many occasions. LSG jump up to the fourth spot with their second consecutive win and they know how to defend totals. They seem to have a pretty settled line-up which bodes well for Rahul and Co. RCB, on the other hand, have now lost three of their four matches which includes back-to-back losses at home. Yash Dayal's performance with the ball and Lomror's blitz are the only positives from this game. While a lot of talk has been on their bowling, their famed batting line-up is yet to fire as a unit. They are currently placed second from bottom and it's time to bring curtains on this encounter. Tune in tomorrow for I0$ Until then, it's goodbye from Abhinand Raghavendran, Akshay Maanay, Ramakrishnan MS and Praveen</p>",

We got off to a really good start, Quinton gave us a really good start. By the time the opposition found out what were the lengths to hit, we had gotten away with the game and had probably 10-15 runs ahead of what we needed to be. That's what helped us in the back end though they bowled really well in the back end. The chat was very simple - there's a bit help in the wicket, try and use the wicket, not go to the yorkers really quickly. Here in Chinnaswamy, the pressure can come on you really quickly with one or two fours/sixes in an over, just changes everything. It's important\u00a0to stay calm and keep trusting that the wicket will help us. One ball hit me really hard, so happy to see Mayank bowl the way he's been bowling in the last couple of games. He's quietly patiently waited for two seasons in the dug-out, missed out last year because of injury unfortunately. But he's been in Bombay with the physios working really hard. He understands that bowling 155 is not easy and in a young age, he's had a few injuries. He's really professional in looking after his body, it's really good to see and has a great temperament. <b>Enjoying seeing him bowl from probably 20 yards behind the stumps, that's where I'd like to be when he's bowling.</b> I am always tempted to bowl first, that's generally been the trend in T20 cricket. If I have a look at our record, it speaks differently. The good thing that I am doing is losing the toss, that really helps. If we get bowled out or if the opposition blasts us out of the game, then there's something to go back and think about. If we are doing most things right ... it's okay to lose sometimes, the opposition is also going to turn up on the ground and want to win. We don't really stress too much about it. The first game was one such game, we tried really hard, they bowled better than us. We have bounced back really well. This is how we generally play our cricket. Powerplay bowling has always been a question mark for us in the two seasons that we have played, trying to fix that. We've gone spin this game, very obvious match-up against RCB which worked. We'll try to find ways to get those wickets in the powerplay.</p>",

Clinical performance from the visitors. Inserted to bat, they posted an above-par total on a two-paced trick. The RCB bowlers had their moments but QdK's half-ton, Stoinis's cameo in the middle overs and Pooran's five sixes in the death overs resulted in LSG crossing 180. In the second innings, LSG started with two left-arm spinners against Faf and Kohli. Siddharth started well by bowling quick and not offering any width. The RCB openers adjusted and the 25-year-old conceded three boundaries on the trot. However, the TN spinner smartly bowled one slowly to nip out the in-form Kohli. Mayank Yadav, the pace sensation, was introduced in the final over of the powerplay and he wasted little time to get into the act. Suicidal running coupled with Padikkal's brilliance resulted in Faf's dismissal and Maxwell was nipped out for a duck by Mayank who troubled the big-hitter with pace and bounce. The 21-year-old added one more wicket in his following over as he castled the other Aussie all-rounder. And, RCB were reduced to 58/4 in the eighth over.</p>",
