But he holed out in the deep when the hosts were just 25 away from the target, and the lower-order couldn't get them over the line. Bumrah stood out again for MI, taking wickets with the new ball and then coming back to break a dangerous partnership by getting rid of Shashank Singh.

In this format the ball swings two overs. When I want to bowl more, I play Test cricket. That fulfills my desires. This format is a little difficult for bowlers, with time restrictions and impact player rules. Batting lineup becomes deeper and deeper. But that's not in your control. I do relay the message to the bowlers whenever I can. But you also don't want to deliver too many messages in the heat of the moment.</p>",
