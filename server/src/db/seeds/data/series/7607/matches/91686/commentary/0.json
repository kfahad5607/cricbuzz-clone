    "commText": "<p><b>Preview</b> by <b>Pratyush Sinha</b> \\n \\nThere's no direct flight from <b>Jaipur to </b>Guwahati. The fastest you can get from one city to the other is 4 hours and 15 minutes. On first glance, traveling far east to play a \"home\" game might make little sense for Rajasthan Royals but when <b>Riyan Parag</b> was addressing the media on the eve of the game and speaking about his familiarity with the conditions to a packed room, it felt like a home game and then some. \\n \\nOf course, much of the RR squad don't have first-hand knowledge of the venue but the <b>Barsapara Cricket Stadium</b> has pulled all the stops to make them feel at home. The giant hoardings, the underlit roof canopies, the dancing LEDs on the supporting pillars and the table mats are all pink and in perfect agreement with the colour that RR have made their own but yet, there must remain a sense that the team would be playing some 2000 kilometers away from their traditional home. \\n \\nThis feeling, though, of being so near yet so far is not unfamiliar to RR this season. They looked primed to seal a spot in the PlayOffs when they went on to lose three on the trot. They remain the favourites, mind you, to become the second team to qualify even before they take the field (more on that below), notwithstanding how they have been guilty of sweating the last mile. But as <b>Parag</b> said, the defeats haven't meant that his side has \"done everything wrong\" in those games. Perhaps a change of venue then, with its promise of high scores after Chennai, couldn't have come at a better time. \\n \\nFor the eliminated <b>Punjab Kings,</b> playing a match that will have no bearing on their qualification must feel like a bad habit, for it's been a decade since they have made it to the PlayOffs. No other team has had to wait longer. But it is what it is and all they would want from this match is an encore from last year, when they beat RR at this very venue by five runs. Fortunately, they boast of wins in their last three away fixtures - Ahmedabad, Kolkata, and Chennai - and a lot of this game will be how much \"away\" they can make this for RR. \\n \\n<b>When:</b> RR v PBKS, Match 65 at 7:30 PM IST/Local \\n \\n<b>Where:</b> Barsapara Cricket Stadium, Guwahati \\n \\n<b>What to expect:</b> <b>Guwahati,</b> with its shiny black-soil pitches, has been a high-scoring venue lately despite <b>70-meter square boundaries,</b> with the average first-inning total in the last four T20 matches here being a shade over <b>213.</b> <b>Parag</b> expects much of the same this time around too, with dew playing a crucial part in his opinion. The effects of it were on show in the last T20I played at this venue, when <b>India's 222/3</b> wasn't enough against <b>Australia and Glenn Maxwell.</b> \\n \\n<b>Head to Head:</b>RR 16 - 11 PBKS. Since 2020, RR have won 6 of the 8 matches between the sides. \\n \\n<b>Team Watch:</b> \\n \\n<b>RAJASTHAN ROYALS</b> \\n \\n<b>Qualification scenario:</b> A win against PBKS will confirm RR's playoffs berth but they might end up taking the field as a qualified side if Delhi Capitals beat Lucknow Super Giants on Tuesday. \\n \\n<b>Injuries/Availability:</b> <b>Jos Buttler</b> has flown back home to prepare for the T20I series against <b>Pakistan</b>, as was indicated by <b>the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB)</b> while announcing the provisional T20 World Cup squad. RR have been practicing with <b>Tom Kohler-Cadmore</b> as the \"back-up\" for Buttler, Parag said on the eve of the match, and the <b>Somerset wicketkeeper-batter is likely to make his IPL debut and partner Yashasvi Jaiswal</b> at the top of the order. \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> Led by <b>Yuzvendra Chahal's</b> resurgence, RR's spinners started the season in full force but have tailed off since then. Compared to the first six games, their average has nearly doubled and the economy-rate has gone up by almost two-and-a-half points despite <b>Ravichandran Ashwin</b> picking five wickets in the last two matches and it's an area RR would like to get back to their best at. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Yashasvi Jaiswal, Tom Kohler-Cadmore, Sanju Samson(w/c), Riyan Parag, Shimron Hetmyer, Dhruv Jurel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Trent Boult, Avesh Khan, Sandeep Sharma, Yuzvendra Chahal [Impact Player: Nandre Burger/Rovman Powell] \\n \\n<b>PUNJAB KINGS</b> \\n \\n<b>Injuries/Availability:</b> <b>Liam Livingstone and Kagiso Rabada</b> have returned home to tend to niggles before the upcoming T20 World Cup, assistant coach <b>Brad Haddin</b> confirmed on the eve of the game, but the likes of <b>Sam Curran and Jonny Bairstow have travelled to Guwahati</b> and are expected to turn up against RR. <b>Shashank Singh,</b> who collided with <b>Faf du Plessis</b> in the last game and endured a sore shoulder, is fit again and likely to play. \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> Like RR, the PBKS would want an amped-up performance from their spinners. They played a crucial role in victories at Chepauk and Mullanpur and have been amongst the more economical spin attacks this season but have struggled to dent oppositions regularly in the middle overs. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Jonny Bairstow(w), Prabhsimran Singh, Rilee Rossouw, Shashank Singh, Jitesh Sharma, Sam Curran(c), Ashutosh Sharma, Harshal Patel, Rahul Chahar, Arshdeep Singh, Vidhwath Kaverappa [Impact player: Harpreet Brar/Nathan Ellis] \\n \\n<b>Did you know?</b> \\n \\nNo batter from PBKS has topped the 400-run chart in either this edition or the last. Shashank Singh, with 352 runs, is their leading run-getter of the season and he is 19th on the overall list. \\n \\nThe last T20I match at this venue saw <b>Ruturaj Gaikwad and Glenn Maxwell</b> score scintillating hundreds \\n \\n<b>Who said what</b> \\n \\n\"All of the talks about India games, all of the talks about me representing North East, me representing Assam etc etc, that's good. I am from here, I am the only player who's playing right now [and] who's probably having a great season till now but as soon as I go in [to bat] I don't think about that. I am here to play good cricket and that's what I will do.<b>\" - Riyan Parag</b></p>",
