The home side looked down and out after Khaleel and Kuldeep combined to pick 5 of the first 7 wickets. Khaleel struck twice in the powerplay while Kuldeep picked three wickets - Stoinis, Pooran and Rahul - in his first two overs. At 94/7 there was every chance of LSG being bowled out inside 20 overs, but Badoni played some sensible cricket - saw off the threat from Kuldeep and then took on the pacers. This total by no means is a daunting one especially with better batting conditions but it is something at least that LSG can look to defend. Back soon with the chase..</p>",
