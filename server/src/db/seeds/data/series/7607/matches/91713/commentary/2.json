Taide and Rossouw played lovely knocks, while Prabhsimran scored 70-odd as the Kings finished with a daunting total of 214/5. With the kind of form Sunrisers Hyderabad batters have been in, the target wasn't going to challenge them. They did lose Travis Head in the first over of the run chase, however, Abhishek and Tripathi counterattacked in the powerplay and shifted the pressure back on the Punjab bowlers. Nitish Reddy and Klaasen chipped in with pivotal knocks and although they lost a few wickets towards the end, they got over the line in the final over. The result of the next game decides whether it's Sunrisers or Rajasthan to join KKR for Qualifier 1. Stay around for the presentations..</p>",
