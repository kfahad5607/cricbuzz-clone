But LSG bowlers got their acts together in the last 5 overs and bowled to certain plans to restrict the score a little. The last four overs prior to the 20th saw 36 runs being scored. Samson didn't get much strike also. That also didn't help. Earlier, Buttler and Jaiswal got starts but threw it away. RR's number 4 in the form of Parag batted fearlessly and scored 43 in quick time. LSG bowlers missed their lengths at times and that was taken severe toll of when the Samson-Parag partnership was on. The chase will be a tough one. But expect Rahul and co. to give a good account of themselves.</p>",
