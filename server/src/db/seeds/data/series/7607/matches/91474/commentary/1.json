The team fifty came in the 3rd over, his fifty came off 16 balls, the team 100 took just 5 overs and they were 125 for 0 at the end of the batting PP. Delhi Capitals looked dead and buried, but they did enjoy a good phase as they reduced the Sunrisers from 131 for 0 to 151 for 4, but Shahbaz then took control, goaded his young and inexperienced partner, Nitish Kumar, and then finished with a flourish. His\u00a029-ball 59* taking his team to a massive total. Chasing 278, MI made 246, chasing 288, RCB made 262 and DC can take comfort from those chases. But scoreboard pressure is a different thing and they'll have to bat extremely well if they're to compete. We should be in for some more fun if they do get close. Back for the chase shortly..</p>",
