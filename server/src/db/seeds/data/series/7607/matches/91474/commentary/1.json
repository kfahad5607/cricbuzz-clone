There was a message to assess the wicket today and I think Travis did really well in that today. It\u2019s always a pleasure since day 1, I\u2019ve been telling him that I\u2019ve been a big fan of him from day 1. We\u2019re lucky he\u2019s in our team. There\u2019s no pressure from the other end so I can just go out and express myself. (About being ready to bowl) I\u2019m always ready, waiting to go out there.</p>",
