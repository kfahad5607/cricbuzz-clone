Nuwan Thushara took the first three and then Pandya and Chawla chipped in to leave KKR at 57/5. KKR had no other option but to use their batting impact sub and out came Manish Pandey. Pandey and Iyer resurrected the innings with a 83-run stand and the stage was set for DreRuss to explode. He started with a six but was run-out after a mix-up which potentially cost KKR 20 runs. Bumrah was outstanding at the death as he mopped up the innings with a three-fer. The end overs acceleration did not come and what looked like 190 has turned out to be 169. Advantage MI but this pitch is sticky and it's holding a bit. The spinners will definitely come into play and KKR have two gun ones. Back for the chase in 5 minutes...</p>",
