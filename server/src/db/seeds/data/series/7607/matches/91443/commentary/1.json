Angkrish Raghuvanshi came in and looked fluent from the word go while Narine also grew in confidence by hitting some expansive shots. A cameo from Raghuvanshi kept things moving - after his fall, Shreyas Iyer also fell cheaply against the run of play. But, there was no stopping Narine as he tore into the RR bowlers. He hit the ball all around the park and made the best bowling attack of this season so far look ordinary. Avesh and Boult were the only ones who conceded less than 10 an over. A breezy cameo from Rinku SIngh helped KKR's cause as they propelled to a massive score. But, this is a great track for batting and with short boundaries, no score is safe. SRH gave the home side a run for their money when they scored 208. Should be an exciting chase! Join us shortly...</p>",

So just go there and try to give your team a good start. We have an understanding about it, it's not going to be easy (bowling here), we have to make use of the powerplay, pick up early wickets and make sure that we control in the middle and try to restrict them.
