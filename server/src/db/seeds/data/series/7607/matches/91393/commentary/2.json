Remember, Ashwin conceded 30 off his last 2 overs and just stuck to bowling quicker darts and carrom balls. That never-ending 19th over from Kuldeep Sen which cost them 20 runs. And eventually because of the slow-over rate they had to bring a fielder inside for the final over.

Mathematically both batters needed to hit 22 off 9 balls and that's how the thinking goes and if one batter goes berserk that will do. I would have loved to finish the game, but very happy with Rahul and Rashid bhai for finishing the job for us. Winning the ball off the last ball is always a great feeling. He (Rashid Khan) is someone who you always want in your team, he is such a competitor.</p>",

Happy that I landed the ball where I wanted today and that gave me energy with the bat as well maybe. I haven't bowled much in the last 3-4 months after the surgery and I just lost a bit of grip on the ball and I had a good session after the last game and it really helped me to get back to my best. I really enjoyed my bowling today. It was just a matter of hitting 3-4 sixes and you need to stay positive.</p>",

Sums up the mindset and ease of thinking of a modern day T20 player. If the required rate is under 20 for the last 3-4 overs, teams would just think -- Ah, just a matter of 5 sixes, and a couple of 1s/2s here and there in 2 overs. The term \"I0$\" is almost non-existent in the dictionary of T20 cricket. Whew, what a contest!! Despite the loss, RR continue to hog the top spot in the ladder as a mega battle awaits in Mumbai tomorrow. It's Rohit vs Kohli. MI v RCB. Should be a blockbuster. Do remember to join us for that. Until then, cheers and goodbye from I1$ and I2$.</p>",
