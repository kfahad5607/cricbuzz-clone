[on the bowling] Definitely one of the best, it's early on in the tournament, can't say much as we can improve individually. The only thought\u00a0process before coming on to the field was coming in a better\u00a0way, that's the only\u00a0thought when I was going through\u00a0my rehab. The only conversation we had before the chase was - let's get it as early as possible, we lost a few run-rate points earlier and we covered it up. We just love being in Ahmedabad, we love the stadium, the vibe here and looking forward to play more matches here. We just want to enjoy our win, one at a time and move forward\u00a0learning from it.</p>",

Fraser-McGurk at the top threatened to finish it off in a jiffy but Johnson got him and Warrier chipped in with a couple of wickets. But DC always had one eye on the NRR and they kept going for it. In the end they finished it off in just 8.5 overs which should boost their NRR massively as well as depleting GT's.
