That they managed to take 4 wickets in the chase should be the only solace for them. Fraser-McGurk at the top threatened to finish it off in a jiffy but Johnson got him and Warrier chipped in with a couple of wickets. But DC always had one eye on the NRR and they kept going for it. In the end they finished it off in just 8.5 overs which should boost their NRR massively as well as depleting GT's. An early finish here and a totally unexpected result for GT are a very good side at home. Stay tuned for the presentation...</p>",
