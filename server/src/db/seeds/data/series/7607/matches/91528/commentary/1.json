The KKR openers made the most of the reprieves and smashed it around, adding 138 for the opening wicket. They did not take their foot out of the accelerator pedal as every batter who came in after that kept striking the ball cleanly and took the total past 250. Rahul Chahar and Arshdeep were the two bowlers who could walk away with their heads held up while the rest were just taken apart. This is not going to be easy for Punjab Kings especially with their top order misfiring. Hopefully Bairstow clicks for them today along with the others. Back soon..</p>",
