After the first innings, Rajasthan Royals were firm favourites but Punjab fought hard. Inserted to bat, Punjab hardly found any momentum with the bat. Ashutosh Sharma came in as the Impact Player at number eight and top-scored with a 16-ball 31 to take his team's total close to 150 on a sluggish track. In reply, Rajasthan didn't lose a single wicket in the powerplay but they managed to score just 38 runs in that phase. Kotian, batting at the top, struggled and fell in the ninth over. The asking rate was under check but Rabada picked two crucial wickets (Jaiswal and Samson) in two overs. The Punjab bowlers fought valiantly to put the RR batters under pressure. When Jurel holed out to deep midwicket, RR needed 33 runs in 16 balls and that's when the two Caribbean big-hitters joined hands. They scored 18 runs in 4 balls but Curran nipped out Powell with a short ball. With 10 needed off the final over, Arshdeep nailed a couple of yorkers, but Hetmyer held his nerve to take his team over the line with a couple of sixes.</p>",

We stuck to our plans, bowled and fielded well, but I'm confident we'll bounce back in the next game. Three games is a hard way to fully work out the conditions (at the new venue), but we've adapted well, we won the first match and lost two matches by close margins (by 2 runs and 3 wickets), hard to take, but the boys will be lifted by how well we've played in the last couple of games.</p>",

I would be very sad if people are just staying away and not catching it. It gets a bit tough actually - the stadium is full of noise and when people call, we are looking at the ball, we can't look who is coming. I need to tell my fast bowlers that it's a bit easier to catch with the gloves instead of hands. We all were (tensed during the run-chase). Games against Punjab in the last 3-4 years, each and every game is very close, very funny feeling. They were bowling really well, it was a funny game. (On Hetmyer) He has been doing it for years and years. Lots of experience, some composure and some confidence about his skills. He was won games many times. Rovman and Hetty - having them was good. Tanush is an interesting youngster. He came in as an allrounder, he had a fabulous Ranji Trophy season with Mumbai and he's been performing well. He's been impressing all the coaching staff and everyone in the nets. We had a proper, settled batting order after the openers, we didn't want to unsettle it and then bring someone up for just one game. Jos is almost ready for the next game, so we just wanted to try him up the order. Very happy to see him (Jaiswal) spend some time in the middle, get those 30s and 40s. That's what this tournament has taught me from last 10 years - never take it for granted. Last game, we did some really great things and we ended up on the losing side. Today, we made a bit more mistakes and we ended up winning the game. It's a very funny game, so we'd like to keep our heads down and just do the process.</p>",

Even in the last over after I missed the first two balls, he (Boult) came down to me and he was like \"Don't worry, we've got this,\" and I was able to feed off his energy and it really worked. I would have taken it (single with 2 runs needed off 2 balls). I spoke to Boulty and he said, \"I got this.\" After he said that, I was like even if I don't get the other one, I'll try my best to get a single. Even if we don't win it, at least tie it.
