When LSG batted, they raced to 52 for 1 while chasing a meagre 145. LSG closed the game during these two phases. Kishan and Wadhera recovered\u00a0it a little for MI but they were clearly short by at least 25 on that deck. Credit to Stoinis for having cashed in on his good form. He got out for a duck in his last game but brushed it aside as an aberration tonight. Mayank's injury concerns would be the only thing that LSG would be worried about. They are gelling well. We gelled well and dished you every update of the game. But time for us to wrap it up. Our team of <b>Abhinand Raghavendran, Nikhil Jadhav, Siva and Kumar Abhisekh Das</b> bids you bye bye! Ciao!</p>",

So to be able to fightback against Mumbai Indians and get the points, that's certainly a smile. What I am learning in this competition is every game is hard and every game is vital. So to get the points, we are thrilled with that. (Bowling performance) It was outstanding, I thought we had all bases covered. You are always looking to take wickets in the powerplay. When you do that, you are always ahead of the game. It's the first time, besides Bangalore early in the tournament, we took those early wickets and that set us up nicely. (On Mayank Yadav) Looks like he's sore in the same spot, his rehab's been absolutely perfect, he bowled pain-free in the last few week or so, he's looked in great condition. We'll have a scan and we'll find out tomorrow. (On Marcus Stoinis) He's been a real match-winner. Took a good catch early as well. He's just showing us that presence at the top of the order which we probably demanded after the first 4 or 5 games. He's showing that real presence, he's playing well, he's being a match-winner. In T20 cricket, in IPL cricket, in big tournaments, match-winners are crucial if you are going to keep progressing. It's such a tight tournament, I have been blown away by how brilliant this IPL tournament is. It's a bit like a World Cup. There's no easy games, every point is crucial. We see how tight it is on the table. For us to take those points tonight, really valuable. Most importantly, after our disappointing last loss, I loved how we fought back and that's a sign of a really good team.</p>",
