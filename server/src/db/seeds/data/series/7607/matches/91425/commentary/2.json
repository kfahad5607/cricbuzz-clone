Between their ages, you can fit in all the cricket experience of all the star studded rosters, but that can't substitute for what the power of a united team with a clear vision can do on the big stage. Chasing 206, Mumbai Indians got off to a great start as they raced past to 70 after 7 overs. However, Pathirana struck with his first ball, and then dismissed Suryakumar Yadav in the same over. MI however recovered with Rohit Sharma and Tilak Varma stitching a partnership again, as they kept in check with the asking rate. Once again, Pathirana proved to be the difference as he dismissed Varma. That wicket brought Hardik Pandya to the centre and it really wasn't his day, as he chewed up six balls and took the momentum off the chase. He holed out to Deshpande and from that point, MI never got back in the chase. A famished Rohit Sharma kept fighting till the end, but he didn't get the support from the other end. Despite a superb 100 from the opener, the hosts fell short by 20 runs. Stick around for the presentations.</p>",
