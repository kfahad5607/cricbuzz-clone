Mind you, this is a pitch where the slower balls are gripping and as we saw in the second half of the innings, the batters found it really difficult to time their shots. Ravindra fell early trying to play a cross-batted stroke. Gaikwad looked promising but wasted his start. Dube walked in and did his reputation of being a spin basher no harm. Surprisingly, Cummins asked his spinners to bowl two overs to him and that allowed him to get in the flow. Rahane played some eye-catchy strokes but once the ball got a bit older and the SRH pacers used the slower balls, he found it difficult and eventually perished. Cummins sent back the dangerous Dube with a short ball. Two new batters at the crease allowed the hosts to control the show. Mitchell struggled but Jadeja played a decent hand to get CSK to 165. All the SRH pacers were miserly and picked up a wicket each. SRH do have the firepower but CSK also have the arsenal to contain them on a slowish pitch. Would be an interesting run-chase...</p>",
