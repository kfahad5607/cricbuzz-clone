Their bowlers set it up with an impressive performance in the afternoon as they restricted a dangerous SRH batting line-up to 162 on a slightly two-paced surface. Mohit Sharma was the pick of the bowlers as he picked a three-fer and the Afghan spin twins - Noor and Rashid - bowled well in the middle overs. In reply, Saha got his team off to a brisk start before perishing to Shahbaz in the powerplay. Shubman Gill got a start and looked in good touch but he holed out immediately after the strategic timeout. SRH exerted some pressure on the hosts with a couple of tight overs. However, Sai Sudharsan and Miller never panicked. Washington Sundar, the Impact Player, wasn't effective and the two left-handers went after Markande in the 16th overs which went for 24 runs (Wd 4 4 Wd 1 6 1 6). That turned out to be the decisive over. Cummins managed to nip out Sai and somehow dragged the match to the final over but Miller, despite hobbling, showed his prowess to take his team home.</p>",

Hopefully by the time we come back, we will have good momentum into this tournament. The way our bowlers bowled in the middle overs, especially Noor ... obviously Rashid bhai is a world-class bowler and he's always coming in and giving his best, but the way Darshan came in and bowled those two crucial overs at the death was very important for us. (On Mohit) He's such\u00a0an experienced player, especially on wickets like these. He comes in day in day out, he practises his skills and he's so skilled. It's not easy in this heat to bowl four overs back-to-back, sometimes three overs back-to-back. But he comes in, bowls those yorkers, slower ones and mixes it so well. The credit has to go to him for practising those skills and to be able to have the confidence to execute them in the match. In this heat, wherever we play in the day match, it's easier to score with the new ball. Once the ball gets old and the wickets gets slow, it's difficult to hit those sixes, especially on the longer side and that was our plan - to be able to let them hit the slower ones on the longer side. (On his dismissal) The ball was there to be hit, I was just backing my shot, but the ball hit the bottom and it didn't bounce as much as I expected it to be but that's fine. In T20, you have to always keep your options open and if the ball is there, you have to go for it. Once we saw how our spinners were bowling, we thought 160-170 would be a good score. Credit to the bowlers how they came in and restricted them to that total. Everybody knows their roles in terms of batting or bowling, Sai has been playing well, Wriddhi bhai has been doing what Wriddhi bhai does and it was important for us to be able to get Miller back in form. Just cramps (on Miller's status).</p>",

It\u2019s important when you have two balls in mind, the batters are also ready, they are ready for the slower bouncer but they are not ready for the slower short ball wide of the wicket so I mix and match. Dew is uncontrollable and we practice bowling with a wet ball. When it\u2019s going good, I enjoy. When the match gets over, I like to reflect where I did well and where I didn\u2019t.
