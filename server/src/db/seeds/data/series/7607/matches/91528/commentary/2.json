Punjab were culprit of falling short by little margins before tonight but they have managed to silence a lot of their critics. They were relentless. They never took off the pedal barring a few overs from Narine. Third win for PBKS and they are still in the fray. KKR stay at number 2 but the confidence of their bowlers would have been hit for sure. This will be a tough pill to swallow. We will need sleeping pills to mellow down our nerves.
