Mohammed Siraj bowled in good rhythm to nip out both the GT openers and Green nipped out the in-form Sai Sudharsan with a short ball. The visitors were reduced to the lowest powerplay total of this season. Shahrukh Khan was joined by Miller and they counterattacked to stitch a fifty partnership. Karn dropped Miller on 23, conceded a six in the following over but he had the last laugh as he induced a mishit from the big-hitter to break the 61-run stand. Shahrukh followed him n the very next over, courtesy suicidal running. Rahul Tewatia struck a few boundaries but RCB exploited the two-paceness of the track. RCB are favourites to win three on the bounce. Join us in a bit to find out if Gujarat can put up a fight with the ball.</p>",
