    "commText": "<p><b>Preview by Vijay Tagore</b> \\n \\nBhvneshwar Kumar has been going at more than 13 an over in the death overs. It was largely due to a stroke of luck that Rovman Powell missed a full toss to hand SunRisers Hyderabad a one-run victory in the SRH's previous game. The win underscores the unpredictability or, as they say, the funny nature of the Twenty20 format. The Royals needed 12 runs off the last over, and two off the last ball. \\n \\nThat win may have put their campaign back on the rails. Still, SRH have been one of the standout sides this season with their explosive openers - Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma - setting the stage on fire and fast bowling unit, led by Pat Cummins, working like an optimally functioning apparatus. The best feature yet has been the inspiring captaincy of Cummins, who has managed to handle the young Indian players efficiently. \\n \\nA rare vulnerability for the Hyderabad side, as it's been observed, is their lack of a Plan B, rather contingencies. They normally rely heavily on aggressive batting, particularly through their openers. And in instances where this approach doesn't produce the expected yields, they've struggled to adapt and recalibrate their gameplan. Spin bowling has emerged as another notable weakness, despite the presence of legend Muttiah Muralitharan in the coaching staff. As they prepare to face Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede on Monday evening, these are areas the home team look to exploit. \\n \\nThe Wankhede Stadium has traditionally been a high-scoring pitch, except for the recent exception seen in the last game, versus Kolkata Knight Riders. It wouldn't be surprising if Monday's match turns into a run-fest, reminiscent of their season's initial encounter in Hyderabad where Mumbai Indians had mounted a strong assault on SRH total and had come close to chasing down the record-breaking total of 278. \\n \\nA lot will depend on the performance of the openers from both teams. \\n \\nFor Mumbai Indians, their openers have struggled to survive the PowerPlay overs in numerous games. Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan have been dismissed early too often, with Rohit falling six times and Ishan seven times within the first six overs. This inconsistency might be one of the key factors to their underwhelming performance this season. They may face a stronger challenge from SRH pacers, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Pat Cummins, T Natarajan, Jaydev Unadkat and Marco Jansen, who have all been in good nick. How the MI openers, mainly Rohit, handle the quality SRH pacers will be a point of interest from MI point of view and Indian point of view as well. \\n \\nFor SRH, this match holds significant importance in their quest to qualify for the playoffs. Currently standing within striking distance with 12 points from 10 games, they require at least two more victories in their remaining four matches. As for MI, with their playoff chances now virtually over, the big question is whether they will opt to rest Jasprit Bumrah, arguably the standout bowler of this IPL season. \\n \\n<b>When:</b> Monday, May 6, 19:30 IST \\n \\n<b>Where:</b> Mumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad, IPL 2024, Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai \\n \\n<b>What to expect:</b> A lot depends on the nature of the pitch. Otherwise a batting strip, the Wankhede surface was tricky to score in the last game a couple of nights ago. Easy or difficult to bat, the captain winning the toss will choose to field because of the dew factor.Anything less than 200 will not be easy to defend. \\n \\n<b>Head to Head:</b> MI 12 - 10 SRH. The face-off figures, overall, are not too stark but Mumbai Indians enjoy an edge at the Wankhede Stadium, 5-2. But the Surrisers have been a different side this season. \\n \\n<b>Team Watch:</b> \\n \\n<b>Mumbai Indians</b> \\n \\n<b>Injury/Availability:</b> No injury concerns for the home team. \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> Skipper Hardik Pandya will prefer to bowl Jasprit Bumrah, the best bowler of the league, upfront given the explosive starts that SRH openers, Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, have been providing. An early breakthrough will go a long way in restricting the visitors. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Ishan Kishan (wk), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya (c), Naman Dhir, Tim David, Gerald Coetzee, Piyush Chawla, Jasprit Bumrah, Nuwan Thushara [Impact Substitute: Nehal Wadhera] \\n \\n<b>Sunrisers Hyderabad</b> \\n \\n<b>Injury/Availability:</b> All players are available for Pat Cummins. \\n \\nTactics & Matchups: With Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Pat Cummins, T Natarajan, Jaydev Unadkat and Marco Jansen all in fine form, the pace will be the main form of attack. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Anmolpreet Singh, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Nitish Reddy, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan [Impact Substitute: Jaydev Unadkat/Umran Malik] \\n \\n<b>What they said</b> \\n \\nWe have a huge fan base and they want to see us win. Our approach, from the beginning, has been to play each game to win and it will not be any different tomorrow - MI batter Naman Dhir, when asked about their approach to the game when their chances of a play-offs berth are bleak \\n \\nLook, that's, that's [Possibility of Umran Malik's inclusion]. That's always going to be an ongoing conversation. The way that we pick our team is very much a game-to-game situation. We know the quality that someone like Umran has and we're obviously at a new venue tomorrow, new opposition tomorrow, and I'm sure through the course of the day his name may come up in selection conversation - SRH pace bowling coach James Franklin on whether Umran Mailk will get to play a game</p>",

He had a brilliant outing in the previous game against KKR. Going to be a big challenge for him against this destructive opening pair.
