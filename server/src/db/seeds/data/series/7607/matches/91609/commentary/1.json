That included another golden duck for Dube and the innings needed consolidating. Moeen and Jadeja added a little stand after Mitchell was trapped LBW. Mo did not make it big and wickets continued to fall. CSK must have considered Sameer Rizvi as the impact sub when wickets were falling but instead they sent Santer and Thakur ahead of Dhoni who again was kept back for the last two overs. Rahul Chahar came back and bowled another couple of good overs at the death while Harshal bowled an exceptional 19th over which included 2 in 2, getting Thakur and Dhoni off successive balls. No party today for the men in yellow who turned up to see another Dhoni special. The last over saw Jadeja hit a four and a six before he fell. 167 on this looks at least 20 short.

One of the advantages of playing a day game is that the square is quite rough. So the ball starts reversing. In my first over it was reversing. It's all about the feel of that delivery (slower one). More you bowl the better you get. Most batters don't pick it. Have been practicing in the nets, and when it comes out it gives you great results.</p>",
