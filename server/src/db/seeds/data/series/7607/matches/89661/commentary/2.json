Curran went after his fifty and Khaleel introduced some excitement in the penultimate over with 2 wickets and a dropped catch but Livingstone finished it off. A measured chase this from PBKS who were helped by Ishant hobbling off. Ishant's overs had to be covered up and Sumit Kumar was no match there. Also Mitch Marsh had a forgettable day with the ball.
