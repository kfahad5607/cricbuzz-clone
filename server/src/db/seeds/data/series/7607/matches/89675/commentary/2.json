What worked well for me was the hard length and keeping calm and not panicking and sticking to what I do well. I have always wanted to play in India and the crowd was amazing. Sat next to Shubman in the bus on our way to the ground. He was calming me. We talked through the game. He is unbelievable as a young captain.</p>",

It's all about holding your nerves. He (Sai Sudharsan) has been a revelation for us. We just wanted to build on the pressure and wait for them to make mistakes. The crowd is one thing, have always come whether it is a day game or a night game and shout out to all the fans who have come here to support us. I thought that was a good score, but we definitely left at least 15 runs there, it was hard to hit those short balls as the wicket got a bit slow towards the end.</p>",

I am just taking it as an extra opportunity to try and win a game for my team. After a few balls, I felt this is that kind of a wicket where you can go hard everywhere and wanted to build on the momentum. Too many great contributions in the second innings and I am actually shocked to be receiving this award. As a batter, I found it tough when they took the pace off and our bowlers executed really well today.</p>",
