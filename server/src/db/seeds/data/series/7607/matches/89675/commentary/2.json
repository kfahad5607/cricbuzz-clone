All teams have now finished round one, and the action shifts to garden city tomorrow as RCB and Punjab Kings await their second game of the season. Jeers for Hardik Pandya, Mohit Sharma's revival, Umesh Yadav's final over, Sai-Rashid's spinning web....there will be lots of talking points from this game and do remember to check this space for all the spicy (news) and exclusive content.

I am just taking it as an extra opportunity to try and win a game for my team. After a few balls, I felt this is that kind of a wicket where you can go hard everywhere and wanted to build on the momentum. Too many great contributions in the second innings and I am actually shocked to be receiving this award. As a batter, I found it tough when they took the pace off and our bowlers executed really well today.</p>",
