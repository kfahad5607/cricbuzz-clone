It is that time of the year again where groups of 11 blokes from 10 different teams running around a field with bat and ball give a vague sense of meaning and relevance to our lives. It is that time of the year where the collective mental state of cricket aficionados are dictated by the colour of the cloth of players representing different regions in the country.</p>",
