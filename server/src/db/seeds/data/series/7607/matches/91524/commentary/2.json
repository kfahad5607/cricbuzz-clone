The pitch, which was on the slower side, certainly played its part and wasn't to the liking of the big-hitters that the hosts possess. But RCB used the conditions smartly as well, opening the bowling with Jacks against the destructive left-handed duo. There was some grip on offer, and Jacks struck gold with the wicket of Travis Head in the first over. It was just a sign of things to come as spin went on to do a lot more damage, the highlight being the wicket of Klaasen by RCB debutant Swapnil Singh. Karn Sharma bowled superbly as well to finish with figures of 2/29 and the three of them derailed SRH's run chase entirely. Whatever fight was left was snuffed out by Cameron Green who had a good outing with both bat and ball.</p>",

    "commText": "<p>The struggles of Kohli and the Sunrisers on that pitch just go on to show how good that knock from Rajat Patidar was. He timed the ball beautifully, scored four consecutive sixes off Markande, and brought up his fifty off just 19 balls. Cameron Green also played a big role to finish the innings nicely with the bat. And then RCB's spinners came to the party as Sunrisers ran out of steam for once. It seemed like the top three on the table were pulling away from the rest, but this result opens things up a bit. That's it for now. This is Sagar Chawla signing off on behalf of Siva and Abhinand Raghavendran. Goodnight!</p>",
