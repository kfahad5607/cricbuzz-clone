Mind you, Phil Salt got going by smashing three successive sixes against Jansen in the just the second over. The Kolkata batters gifted their wickets away - Narine run-out, Venkatesh and Shreyas perishing while playing aerial shots and Rana falling while attempting a reverse-hit. Ramandeep Singh came out all guns blazing and provided the much-needed impetus to the innings. Salt fell after notching up his fifty which brought the two power-hitters together. Russell joined Rinku and went berserk. Smashed three sixes an over off Markande and it was just the start of something spectacular. Brute power on display and the Jamaican recorded a 20-ball fifty. <b>85 runs off the last five overs!</b> SRH were really good with their fielding but they didn't execute their plans in the death overs apart from Natarajan's final over. Nevertheless, not much assistance for the bowlers here and don't rule out SRH. Reply coming up shortly...</p>",
