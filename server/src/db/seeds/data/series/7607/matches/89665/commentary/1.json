The Kolkata batters gifted their wickets away - Narine run-out, Venkatesh and Shreyas perishing while playing aerial shots and Rana falling while attempting a reverse-hit. Ramandeep Singh came out all guns blazing and provided the much-needed impetus to the innings. Salt fell after notching up his fifty which brought the two power-hitters together. Russell joined Rinku and went berserk. Smashed three sixes an over off Markande and it was just the start of something spectacular.
