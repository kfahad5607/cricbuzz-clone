With those early wickets, KL Rahul was a bit tepid in the powerplay but broke free after the powerplay, plundering 21 runs off an Avesh Khan over. Hooda from the other end also played some eye catching strokes, carrying on from where he left off against CSK. Both batters scored fifties but Hooda holed out against Ashwin. Rahul however kept scoring some classical strokes, and made use of the longer boundaries to score plenty of doubles. He was looking good for a hundred, but striked out against Avesh Khan at the death. LSG got cameos from Pooran and Badoni at the end, but RR fought back well, conceding just 24 off the last three overs thanks to some solid bowling from Sandeep Sharma.
