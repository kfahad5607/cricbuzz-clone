Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head started it off, and Markram backed it up with an excellent fifty as he maneuvered the spinners brilliantly. So SRH join CSK with two wins. That's all we have from here. It's a goodbye from Sagar Chawla on behalf of Vinod Kumar, Pradeep Krishnamurthy and Abhinav Guha. Goodnight!</p>",

It was a black soil pitch, so we expected the pitch to be slower, but it became slower and slower, and they used the boundary size well. We conceded too many in the batting PP, one dropped catch and one expensive over. Still, to take them to the 19th over was a great effort. I thought anything around 170-175 would've been a good total for us. There was a bit of dew towards the end, but Moeen got the ball to spin even in the 15th-16th over.
