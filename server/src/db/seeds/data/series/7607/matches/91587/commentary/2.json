They did take two early wickets in the form of Buttler and Samson, however, Jaiswal and Parag had other plans tonight. Jaiswal was dropped by Cummins and the opener made sure that the opposition paid for their mistake. Jaiswal and Parag had an exceptional 134-run partnership, however, none of them were able to carry on and take their team over the line. SRH pacers were clinical at the death and although RR looked in cruise control, the hosts managed to snatch an exciting victory in the closing stages of the game. Stay around for the presentations..</p>",

It was challenging but with the wicket and the way Pat bowled the 19th over, he'd be disappointed with the last ball, but class at the end, two class players, two of the old boys. Very satisfied with the win. I thought that (201) was a great score. Nitish played out of his skin again. He's had a couple of innings now where's he's stepped up, made it look really easy. It was a tough pitch. I felt we had heaps but that's T20 crickets, it comes down to the wire most times. Always nice to win in front of your home fans.</p>",
