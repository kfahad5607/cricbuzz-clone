Just like their season, this game saw them resurrect from the dead on mutliple occasions, but ultimately their sloopy fielding early on came to cost them. Chasing a slightly sub par total of 173, Rajasthan got a decent start with Kohler-Cadmore and Jaiswal both getting runs. Despite the Englishman's wicket, Samson and Jaiswal stitched on a partnership and at a point RR were cantering to a win. However, an inspired spell from Cam Green, coupled with a needless Samson stumping and an electric run out from Virat Kohli made the game interesting. Rajasthan needed 58 off the final six, but Riyan Parag held his own to augment what has been a breakthrough season for him. He took down Green for a six and a four, as Hetmyer played the perfect supporting role from the other end. Both batters couldn't stay the course, but the equation was down to a run a ball, before Rovman Powell added the finishing touches. Stick on for the presentations...</p>",

But what we've found out this season, with the impact player, the par score isn't enough any more. Also with the dew coming in. Extremely proud.

Having said that we have quality batters and you have to accept the role and I am looking forward to contribute more in this role. sometimes you need things like these (Four catches). First catch (off Faf) was the one that let me take four catches. If I had put that down, it would be a haan, tough day in the field kind of situation.

But once you have committed to your franchise, you want to go through with the season. I think we hit the right lengths, the way Boult was bowling, he got a bit of swing and seam movement. In the second innings, I don't think there was a lot of dew. I think there were some exceptional shots from our boys to get that chase. I think our greatest strength is the exuberance of youth and the experience we have got to support that. Now that Hettie is back in, and Rovman got a few boundaries today as well.
