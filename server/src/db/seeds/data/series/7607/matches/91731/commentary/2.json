Just like their season, this game saw them resurrect from the dead on mutliple occasions, but ultimately their sloopy fielding early on came to cost them. Chasing a slightly sub par total of 173, Rajasthan got a decent start with Kohler-Cadmore and Jaiswal both getting runs. Despite the Englishman's wicket, Samson and Jaiswal stitched on a partnership and at a point RR were cantering to a win. However, an inspired spell from Cam Green, coupled with a needless Samson stumping and an electric run out from Virat Kohli made the game interesting. Rajasthan needed 58 off the final six, but Riyan Parag held his own to augment what has been a breakthrough season for him. He took down Green for a six and a four, as Hetmyer played the perfect supporting role from the other end. Both batters couldn't stay the course, but the equation was down to a run a ball, before Rovman Powell added the finishing touches. Stick on for the presentations...</p>",

Really happy with the way we fielded, batted and bowled today. Credit to the bowlers, they are always looking at what the opposition batters would do and what fields to set. Credit goes to Sanga and bowling coach Shane Bond as well. They've spent a lot of time in hotel rooms discussing these things. Plus Ashwin and Boult are experienced lads. (On Parag and Jaiswal) They are 22 each, so is Jurel. With very little experience, the way they are performing at this level is amazing. (On his health) I'm not a 100% actually. There is a bug in the dressing room, lots of coughs and a lot of people are a bit unwell. (Going forward) Rovman finished that off well. I think we have a travel day and rest now, looking forward to the next game.</p>",

Today's win was important. We were a bit rusty chasing it, but this win will give us some confidence. In the first half, I felt my body wasn't moving too well for the first half of the season. I had an abdomen injury as well. I am aging as well. To come into the tournament from Test cricket was difficult, I needed some time to get that bowling rhytmn. But once you have committed to your franchise, you want to go through with the season. I think we hit the right lengths, the way Boult was bowling, he got a bit of swing and seam movement. In the second innings, I don't think there was a lot of dew. I think there were some exceptional shots from our boys to get that chase. I think our greatest strength is the exuberance of youth and the experience we have got to support that. Now that Hettie is back in, and Rovman got a few boundaries today as well. We've got Keshav sitting outside. We have the right momentum for this team going forward.</p>",
