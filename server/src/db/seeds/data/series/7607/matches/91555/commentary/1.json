Coming back to this innings, it was again the Gaikwad show with contributions from Mitchell and Shivam Dube. Rahane fell early but Gaikwad and Mitchell strung together a 107-run stand. Mitchell who hasn't fired at all this season made a timely return to form with his first fifty in the IPL. But it was the CSK skipper though who was the star. Yet another attractive innings and he looked set for consecutive tons till the heat and humidity of Chennai sapped all his energy and by the end of his knock, he was visibly tired and his dismissal was a tired shot. Dube did his job and once again MS did what he does always - come out to milk the crowd and give them what they want - despite facing just 2 balls. Excellent last two overs for SRH as only 20 came off it. Will that be the difference? Let's find out when we are back for the chase in 5 minutes...</p>",
