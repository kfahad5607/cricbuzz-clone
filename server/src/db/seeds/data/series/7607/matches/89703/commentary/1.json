And KKR took pace off nicely and when they gave the batters pace, it was put away. Once again Kohli led the way, with his innings of 83. He started off aggressively in the powerplay, then settled down to nudge it around in the middle overs and again opened out at the death. Faf went early but Green, Maxwell and DK at the end contributed well to help Kohli who was the main man during that innings. KKR's fielding was a let-down as they dropped Maxwell twice and Starc once again proved to be expensive which should be a worry. The powerplay is when the ball comes on nicely and that's where the chase will be key. Back for KKR's reply in 5 minutes...</p>",
