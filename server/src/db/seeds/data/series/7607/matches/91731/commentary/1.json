They've done well to restrict RCB to 172, and should fancy their chances with dew around. A couple of really standout performances with the ball for them, starting with Trent Boult who set the tone with the new ball. He bowled three overs in the powerplay and gave just six runs, including the wicket of Faf du Plessis. There was no width given for the openers, and no freebies on the fuller length either. Having kept the rate in check during the powerplay, RR then turned to their spinners and Ashwin responded beautifully with a brilliant spell where he gave nothing away. The pressure that he built eventually resulted in a couple of wickets in his final over, and with figures of 2/19, he just didn't allow RCB to get away. They weren't able to get away in the death either as Avesh Khan came to the party. He had gone for 30 in his first two overs but finished superbly as the Royals gave away just 47 in the last five overs, denying the final flourish that RCB needed desperately. It's over to their batters now to get the job done.</p>",
