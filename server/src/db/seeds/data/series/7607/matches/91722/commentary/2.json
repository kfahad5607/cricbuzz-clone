They finished the league stage as the number 1 team and they have played like the best team of the season tonight. Couldn't have been anymore convincing. Mitchell Starc got the Knights off to a dream start by dismissing Head for a duck and he bowled a magnificent spell in the powerplay to reduce SRH to 39/4. Tripathi and Klaasen added some pivotal runs, however, the KKR bowlers choked them in the middle overs as Sunrisers finished with a mediocre total. In reply, the KKR openers gave a perfect start, while the two Iyers (Shreyas and Venkatesh) finished off the run chase with an excellent partnership for the third wicket. Head who had a great outing here in the final of 2023 World Cup had a horrible game tonight.

The rejuvenation was important for us. When you travel so much. It's important to stay in the present. Today was the day we had to maximise, we did it and that's what we thrive on. I think the way every bowler stood up to this occasion, the way they came in and took wickets, that was imperative. The attitude and approach of all bowlers was to take wickets and they did. When you have a variety in the bowling line-up, it's mesmerising. They have been true in terms of their work ethics, hopefully we keep performing. It was Gurbaz's first game and he gave an impactful start. We had to make sure we carry forward the same run rate. I don't know tamil, but I understand. Venky speaks in tamil, I reply in hindi (talking about the communication between him and Venkatesh Iyer). We need to be in our zone in the final and make sure we give our best.</p>",

We needed to pick early wickets and get into their middle-order. The way Head and Abhishek have been playing thoughout the tournament, they like width and free their arms. We just tried to swing the ball and not provide them width. Bowl stump to stump and tried the hard length. The spinners were effective and the whole bowling department was great. Got lucky I guess (on taking Head's wicket), was nice to see his back early, not always the case. We have been playing against each other in recent times. They (Arora and Harshit) are exciting to watch and are talented, they are skillful. It's good to see how hard they train. Harshit has been phenomenal this year. Our bowling attack has been great, it's hard to single anyone out. As an older and overseas player, it's good to see. No doubt they'll take many wickets in the IPL and for India as well.</p>",
