Inserted to bat, Narine and Salt got Kolkata off to yet another blazing start. Salt's dismissal barely had an effect on his opening partner who continued to go after the LSG bowlers. Raghuvanshi was happy to play the second fiddle as Narine notched up a 27-ball fifty. After striking three sixes off Stoinis, Narine got a couple of reprieves off successive deliveries but Bishnoi eventually removed him for 81(39). Bishnoi was the pick of the bowlers and Naveen-ul-Haq bowled two decent overs after being expensive. However, Ramandeep Singh played yet another cameo towards the end as he scored a 6-ball 25. Lucknow, playing their final match at home, face an uphill task. Join us in a bit to find out how they fare with the bat...</p>",
