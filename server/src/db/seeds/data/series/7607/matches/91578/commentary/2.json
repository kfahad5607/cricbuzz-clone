But this is the same team that threw away home games against RR, SRH and Gujarat. Year after year, they have been the nearly men. The bridesmaids who get bumped off the playoffs guest list at the last moment.

To be honest, I don't think wickets, my aim is only to bowl lots of dot balls and dot balls create the wickets.

Same as last year, we lost a lot of our home games and won away, finding a similar pattern. We are in a position where we need to win all our games, we come up against the same opposition in a few days. I think when you come to Chennai, you now how hot it is and dew is going to settle in. Today we wanted to try something different by trying Rabada in the powerplay. We wanted to use our spinners later on, so took a punt on trying KG within the powerplay. Chahar came back and was the best bowler in the 260 game, and he's bowling with great confidence. He stepped up when I asked him to bowl against MSD in the 19th over. (On bowling Chahar in the 19th) The pace bowlers were going for a bit in the end, and I wanted to try something different. Asked Rilee what he reckoned and took that gamble with spin. In this game where everyone has been going for runs, you need to take such gambles. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. We come against the same opposition so we have one up on them. It is a new game, new conditions but this win will give us a lot of confidence. I think our bowlers were superb, the spinners and Jonny striking them well, even the way we paced that chase, it was brilliant. Need to build on that confidence.</p>",

We were also surprised that we won by a big margin in the last match considering the conditions (win by 78 runs against SRH). I think the last two games, the conditions and pitch was better, it allowed us to fight hard and get to 200+, today, it wasn't good enough to get to even 180. It's a real problem (on the player missing due to injuries and Chahal walking away in the first over), there are phases where you want wickets, but you have only two bowlers, the dew took the spinners out of the equation.

Prabhsimran provided a breezy start before becoming Richard Gleeson's first IPL victim. Rilee Rossouw came in and started off with two quick boundaries, as PBKS ended the powerplay at a little over 50. They kept the momentum going against the spinners, as the first two overs post the powerplay went for 21 runs. Shivam Dube however halted proceedings as he struck with just his second ball on the season. Shardul then gave CSK a wicket off a low full toss, as Rossouw chopped one back onto his stumps. However, the chase was never in threat despite the wickets, and Shashank Singh and Sam Curran helped the visitors get past the finish line, perhaps a couple of overs delayed than expected.
