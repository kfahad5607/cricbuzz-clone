Entrusted with the responsibility of bowling at the death, he emerged as the trump card for Royals to help them start their campaign with a win. He's the first person Samson goes to and gives him a hug. The captain batted beautifully himself earlier in the day, smashing 82 off just 52 balls and took RR to a big score of 193. However, things seemed to be slipping away from them when KL Rahul and Nicholas Pooran were at the crease. Despite a terrible start to the chase as the top order was dismantled by Boult and Burger, LSG managed to launch a brilliant recovery and they were right on top with 65 needed off the last six overs, with Rahul and Pooran at the crease. It was then that Sandeep was introduced in the attack, and he turned the balance completely with an outstanding spell. Might've only got one wicket, but the way he executed his plans under pressure was a treat to watch. He showed everyone exactly why he's been chosen to bowl those difficult overs, and why the management has put so much faith in him. Stay tuned, we'll have the presentations shortly.</p>",

    "commText": "<p><b>Ravichandran Ashwin:</b> I think it was a wicket of two halves, I thought it stuck in the pitch in the first half, it was a bit tacky, it depends on how much water you put on. Sanju and Riyan batted really well, but I felt we were 10 runs short, with so many impact players coming up in the form of Hetmyer and Jurel. But the pitch holds up well over here. I went for 12 off the first two balls, it needs a different mindset, having come from Test cricket. I'm in a good mental and physical space at the moment though. I went for 15 in the 1st over in the powerplay, I bowl 2 or 3 at times, I try to forget it away, it's a different ball game after the powerplay. It depends on who you'll encounter, for eg: I came up against Krunal, Pooran and Stoinis, that's something I hadn't visualised in the 18th over. The game is built by perceptions, if you look at the way Sandy has bowled, he has been a top-5 bowler (in the IPL) - he's a character, does the dirty work for us, did a lot to cover for Prasidh in the last season as well. I see him as a fighter - bowlers getting 2 bouncers is the only fillip in this format and the bowlers are looking to use it. Boulty has performed for a long time and Nandre did well in his 1st game, I see him doing a lot more in the future.</p>",

This time I've been given different kind of role with slightly different combination we have. Sanga has given me some suggestions to follow. I've been playing IPL for 10 years - there has to be some experience coming in. I feel I need to spend more time and understand conditions. Playing international ODIs also helped me. It's all about understanding your strengths and weaknesses. I'm a batsman who just reacts to the ball - no matter the first ball or the last ball. I should give this trophy to him (Sandeep). If he didn't bowl those three overs, I wouldn't be POTM. I thought I should call him. I heard Ash bhai say it's not just about skill but character in pressure moments. He has that in his eyes, in his body language that you can trust that guy.</p>",
