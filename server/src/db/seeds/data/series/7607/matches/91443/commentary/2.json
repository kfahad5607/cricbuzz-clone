Vaibhav conceded 23 off his 3rd over and RR ended up scoring 76/2 at the end of the powerplay (20 runs more than KKR). Parag took the attack to the KKR bowlers. The duel between Harshit Rana and Parag was fascinating. After conceding a couple of boundaries with pacy balls, the pacer deceived the in-form batter with a slower delivery. That triggered the slide for the visitors. Jurel was trapped by Narine and the move to send Ashwin at six didn't work. The scoring rate dipped significantly and Chakaravarthy picked back-to-back wickets (Ashwin and Hetmyer). Rajasthan scored just 30 runs in the 6-over phase in the middle overs (8-14).

The Englishman, who was on 42 off 33 at one stage, showed what an asset he is in this format. Buttler scored 42 off the last 46 runs to take his team over the line. Came back from illness, batted 20 overs in humid conditions and hit the winning runs off the final ball even though he hardly had anything left in the tank. Just incredible!</p>",

I would second that actually, emotions were a roller coaster, certainly didn\u2019t think we will get into this situation. It\u2019s a funny game at the end of the day, he was striking the ball cleanly and timing them so well, have to take it on the chin and move on. I mean at this point of time you see that you bowl your best deliveries, a little bit hit or miss and you are sent out of the ground, it\u2019s good that it happened now rather than it happening in the later stages of the tournament, good learning for us. (On Sunil Narine) He is a great asset to the team and he is showing it every game, he is that kind of player who capitalizes on each and every moment. I'm glad that he is a part of our team. Since he was striking it so well, I thought let\u2019s take pace off the ball and gave it to Chakaravarthy and it\u2019s high pressure when you have five fielders inside the circle, you basically don\u2019t have idea where to bowl. It\u2019s just about relaxing and rejuvenating, it was very humid as well today. It's important to learn from our mistakes and bounce back. We have a few days break. At the end of the day, it was a great game, a few overs here and there but I\u2019m really proud of the boys.</p>",

When I came into the game, I had a plan to take on Sunil because he is their best bowler and that situation was such that I had to go after him, so I backed my strength and backed my options and it came off today. For my last 12 months I have been whispering in Sunil's ear (requesting him to make a comeback into the West Indies T20 side) but he has blocked out everyone. I have asked his best friends Pollard, Bravo and Pooran and hopefully they will crack his code before they select the team.. The morale in the team is very good, even when I am not playing the communication has been very good and as an international player, I really appreciate when the communication is precise and clear. The guys are in good space and long may that continue. I bat number 4 or 5 for West Indies and if you think West Indies is a good T20 side, then you can push me up the order (responding to whether he keeps asking Sangakkara and Co. to promote him up the order), we have got a few days off now and I will keep ringing it in their (the management) ears.</p>",

We were wondering where can get those couple of sixes and that's when Rovman came in. Jos did what he does for us from last 6-7 years, very happy for him. It (Buttler's knock) should go right on top.

At times you feel frustrated or you\u00a0are questioning yourself. I was trying to tell myself it'd be okay, keep going, you'll get your rhythm back and try to stay calm. There's been plenty of times throughout the IPL, you've seen crazy things happen. Guys like Dhoni and Kohli, the way they stay till the end and keep believing, you've seen it so many times in the IPL and I was trying to do the same. That's something Kumar Sangakkara has told me a lot - there's always a little breaking point. The worst thing you can do when you are not feeling your best is to fight it and try to force the issue and give your wicket away. He just tells me to stay there and at some point, the momentum will change or you'll find your rhythm or one shot will get you going. That's been a big part of my play over the last few years - try to stay the course and not get in my own way. (His greatest IPL innings?) I would think so. Anytime you're not out at the end to see your team through, especially off the last ball, in a big run-chase, very satisfying.</p>",
