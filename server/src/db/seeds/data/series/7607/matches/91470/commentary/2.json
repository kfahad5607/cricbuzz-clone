They needed a win at any cost and they have pocketed it easily. They were geared up for a big tussle but CSK batters just couldn't arrive today. Jadeja and MSD towards the end ensured it was close to 180. Else for a major part of the first innings, CSK were behind the 8-ball. Then QDK and Rahul just came up with a clinical response. Two points have allowed LSG to occupy the fifth position on the table. Their NRR is in positive as well. A herd of four teams were looking to breakaway but LSG wants to be part of the traffic. CSK would feel a little disappointed as they came into this game having defended a score at Wankhede. But three home games from now is just the tonic that the team in yellow won't complain of. We aren't complaining either as we move rapidly towards the half stage in the tourney. Teams are closely packed to each other. And we will continue dishing out every detail. This is our team of <b>MS Ramakrishnan, Abhinand Raghavendran, Siva and Kumar Abhisekh Das</b> signing off.</p>",

Really happy with that. Depends on the wicket, I deploy my bowlers. We tried to mix it around. The bowlers executed really well. The team is sticking to the plans. Halfway stage, I would have been happy with 160. The wicket was slow and a bit of grip. MSD walked in and the pressure got to the bowlers. He has had the intimidation on opposition bowlers. Our young bowlers were put under pressure with the crowd going berserk as well. 15-20 runs extra they got. I have been trying to assess the situation. It came off today. I knew the CSK spinners will put the pressure on. I picked my bowlers and it came off. Quinton batted well as well. Made life easy for both. Different ball game playing in Chennai. Was playing in front of mini Chennai crowd. We are a young team and happy to play in front of such a crowd.</p>",

We've got these guys - Chennai - in a couple of days' time, it's important two games for us, it's nice to be back on the winning board. We are playing good cricket. With how we started with the ball and taking early wickets, I think we could have kept them under that total. Hats off to the way they played and they finished obviously with MS. They played well towards the end but it's a nice wicket and we built some partnerships. Quinny (de Kock) and KL batted beautifully to pretty much seal it and then Nicky (Pooran) came in and iced the cake. That's an important partnership for us at the top. Having that continuity, having\u00a0them get us off to a start allows us to play the rest of the innings and to build an order around it as well. We've got that confidence with our team and the nice thing about this season so far is there's been different boys stepping up and chipping in to win these games at different stages. We've had our bowling attack bowl well, we've had our batters bat well, had our opening partnership tonight. Different people are putting their hand up which I think is a great sign for the team. I said to KL I0$ I wanna bowl, if you can get into the captain's ear and just push that, it'll be great.</p>",

Slightly difficult with such a total, with the impact sub rule you need 10-15 or even 20 runs extra. Pitches like these seem sluggish to start off with but with dew coming on it gets better, 190 would have been a good score. One area we would like to improve in taking wickets in the powerplay. That will put pressure on the opposition. We need to work on it. Good to play them again (next game at Chepauk). We will come up with good homework done now that we have three home games.</p>",

Mustafizur struggled for control and so did Pathirana. But all of this because Rahul batted like a dream. The wicket was a little two-paced. QDK found it a little tough and got a chance as well. But he hung in there and together with Rahul added 134 for the first wicket. That killed off the chase. Earlier, LSG controlled the CSK batting as well to restrict them to 176. LSG picked up wickets with the new ball and in the middle overs and it was MSD who scored a brisk cameo to take them close to 180.
