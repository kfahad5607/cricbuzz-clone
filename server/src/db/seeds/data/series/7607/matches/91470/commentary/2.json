But CSK bowling and fielding was a lot to be desired. They sprayed it to all parts of the deck. Didn't use Ali enough and Jadeja the bowler was put under pressure. Mustafizur struggled for control and so did Pathirana. But all of this because Rahul batted like a dream. The wicket was a little two-paced. QDK found it a little tough and got a chance as well. But he hung in there and together with Rahul added 134 for the first wicket. That killed off the chase. Earlier, LSG controlled the CSK batting as well to restrict them to 176. LSG picked up wickets with the new ball and in the middle overs and it was MSD who scored a brisk cameo to take them close to 180. In hindsight, CSK would feel that they were at least 20 short as LSG barely tried too hard to chase this down.</p>",

With how we started with the ball and taking early wickets, I think we could have kept them under that total. Hats off to the way they played and they finished obviously with MS. They played well towards the end but it's a nice wicket and we built some partnerships. Quinny (de Kock) and KL batted beautifully to pretty much seal it and then Nicky (Pooran) came in and iced the cake. That's an important partnership for us at the top. Having that continuity, having\u00a0them get us off to a start allows us to play the rest of the innings and to build an order around it as well. We've got that confidence with our team and the nice thing about this season so far is there's been different boys stepping up and chipping in to win these games at different stages. We've had our bowling attack bowl well, we've had our batters bat well, had our opening partnership tonight. Different people are putting their hand up which I think is a great sign for the team.
