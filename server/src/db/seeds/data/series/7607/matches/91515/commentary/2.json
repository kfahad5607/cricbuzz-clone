One moment Delhi were dominating, then Gujarat looked like favourites but ultimately it was a target too stiff as DC squeeze through with two points. Chasing a stiff target, GT suffered a big blow as skipper Shubman Gill was out cheaply. Saha scored a sketchy 39, getting many mishits over the infield thanks to the powerplay, as Sai Sudharshan made his mark from the other end. The southpaw scored a neat looking fifty and was looking in control of things before Rasikh Salam nabbed him with a slower delivery. DC seemed to always get wickets when they wanted, and it felt like it was just about going through the motions. However, David Miller had other plans. He took down his countryman Nortje was a 24 run over and got to a fifty in no time. The southpaw however was dismissed by Mukesh Kumar. GT got two more cameos from Sai Kishore and Rashid Khan, but still fell short by 4 runs. I0$ Stick around for the presentations...</p>",

Great fight till the end and we never thought we were out of the game at any point. When you're chasing 224, there's no point in talking about plans, just go out and score runs. I think impact player has a bit of a role (in making the matches high scoring), even if you lose extra wickets, extra cushion is there for the batters to keep going and it gives the license for the batters to keep going till the end. At one stage, we thought we would be able to restrict them to 200-210, but we gave away some extra runs in the last 2-3 overs. But this is a smallish ground, we spoke about the same when we went out to chase. Execution becomes very important, if there's a set batter or a finisher, you'll have to execute well. It's okay if there's something in the wicket, but on pitches like this, you'll have to make sure that you execute all your plans perfectly, be it the yorkers or the variations.</p>",

    "commText": "<p><b>Rishabh Pant | DC Captain and Player of the Match:</b> (On choosing Rasikh for 19th over) Nortje was having a tough time. T20 is a funny game, after 14-15 overs the ball was coming on nicely. So we wanted to trust Rasikh, always trust someone who is bowling well in a game. I think it is about instincts as a captain, it will come off sometimes. Happy it worked today. Surely at 43/3, we wanted to just keep going and target their main spinners. If we get something, we will take it on and keep rotating the strike. Everyday that I'm in the middle, I feel better. Every hour on the field matters, I love being on the field. I try to give it my 100% and it takes some time sometimes. I think the first six in the match gives me the confidence in a game. The more time I spend in the centre, the better I feel.</p>",

With the ground dimensions, the skill of the batters and the impact sub rule, bowling seems to be becoming an afterthought this season. But that\u2019s a debate for another day. For now, let\u2019s cherish another run fest and another close game in the IPL. Tomorrow is going to be no different with SRH hosting RCB. Good luck in advance to all the bowlers for that one! See you then, bye for now from I0$ on behalf of I1$ and I2$</p>",
