Kohli slowed down after the powerplay and was content on nudging and nurdling around. But Patidar took the pressure off him with a 19-ball 50. He hit four consecutive sixes off Markande and he fell at the wrong time for RCB. Green came in and played an useful hand even as Kohli fell after the 2nd strategic timeout, in an attempt to up the rate. Unadkat was the pick of the bowlers for SRH with his slower ball off-cutters doing the damage. T Natarajan too was good as he again kept it tight. At this stage, SRH are favorites.
