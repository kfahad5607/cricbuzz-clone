Siraj provided the early breakthrough by removing Bairstow after conceding back-to-back boundaries. Yash Dayal swung the new ball and kept it tight. Prabhsimran and Dhawan stitched a fifty partnership at a decent rate before Maxwell removed the former. Livingstone came in at four and struck a couple of boundaries off Maxwell's bowling. Joseph bowled the hard length to nip out the English power-hitter and Dhawan fell the very next ball to become Maxi's second victim. At 98/4 in the 13th over, Punjab had two new batters out in the middle and RCB bowled well despite the Curran-Jitesh duo forging a half-ton partnership. Siraj bowled a superb penultimate over but Alzarri leaked 20 runs off the final over. RCB have a power-packed batting line-up and they can also bring in an additional batter as the impact sub. So, they'll fancy their chances to chase this down. How will the visitors fare with the ball? Join us in a bit to find out...</p>",
