But Will Jacks and Rajat Patidar batted brilliantly in the early middle-overs. They took the bowling on and struck sixes at will. Patidar got to yet another fifty and RCB were looking set for another big 200+ total. RCB did have their fair share of luck as DC put down as many as four chances quite early. However, there was a major slowdown around the 12th over. DC's spinners suddenly found some bite off the deck and the track seemed to slow up. Both set batters were dismissed in quick succession and barring an unbeaten 32 from Green, no one else was able to make a significant contribution. Delhi bowled brillaintly at the death as well.
