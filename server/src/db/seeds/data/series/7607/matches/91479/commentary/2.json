RCB gave it their everything today but they'll look back on that period where they lost 4 wickets in 2 overs. Have to feel for Karn Sharma too, he nearly forged his name into the IPL annals but it just wasn't to be tonight. As it always is, joy for one side means heartbreak for the other. KKR were on the wrong side of a last-ball thriller just in their last game so it'll feel good to win this one. They move up to 2nd place on the table and things are looking bright. Can't say the same for RCB as they're firmly rooted to the bottom of the table and it's going to be a hard way up. That's it from us for this game but there's already another game happening between Gujarat and Punjab so make sure you switch tabs. For now, this is<b> Anurag Hegde</b> signing off on behalf of <b>Pradeep Krishnamurthy </b>and <b>Praveen Kumar. </b></p>",

Getting the ball at a crucial time, I knew that I had to come good and thankfully it happened today. Happy for the two points. When I was batting earlier, change of pace was difficult to hit. As a bowler that\u2019s what I wanted to do. The slower balls were gripping and holding. Was happy to get the two set batters out and I think that\u2019s what changed the game. Those two wickets from Narine were also very important and that\u2019s what started the slide for RCB. When I look at the bowling equation, I had two left and I conditioned myself to bowl that (19th) over. Tried to give Starc as many runs as I could. DK wasn\u2019t getting off strike so I looked at bowling 6 deliveries to him and mix it up, thankfully it worked.</p>",

It\u2019s extremely tough when the pressure is on, I feel that every individual should put their hands up and take the responsibility. Russell did that by picking up two wickets and completely changed the game in our favor, that kind of attitude is needed in the team. It\u2019s a funny game, when you need 18 runs off 6 balls, the pressure is on the bowler. One six here and there, it completely changes the momentum. It is important that we maintain our calmness and stay in the present and make the batter hit where you want them to hit. We need to stick to our routines and processes and see to it that we execute the things we want. It was a pivotal knock, I wanted to stay till the end and steady the ship. We were losing wickets and I wanted to stay till the end and see it off. We got some important boundaries towards the end and I was very happy about that.</p>",

The match-up against Narine, I thought that was the game changing over. The small things, I am actually proud of the boys tonight, the way we bowled and fielded, we did give away a couple of big overs towards the end, but I thought we kept them down to a par score. We thought we'll go hard in the batting powerplay, find those boundaries at the start of the innings. We were desperate, 10/10 from an effort perspective, the way we put up the effort in the ground, the faces told the story. We've got an unbelievable fanbase, we want to make them happy, we want them to have a smile on their face. We'll have to continue putting in our efforts and try to change things around.</p>",
