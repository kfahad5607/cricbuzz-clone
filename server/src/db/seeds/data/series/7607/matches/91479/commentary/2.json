Mitch Starc and KKR hold on to dear life and just about keep RCB at bay to win by 1 run! So much to dissect there. Chasing 223 to win, Kohli got off to a bit of a flier before being dismissed by a loopy full-toss. He was absolutely livid as he walked off and his dismissal was the first of many talking points of the game. Faf followed soon after but Patidar and Jacks kept RCB going. They ensured that RCB remained on par if not ahead of the asking rate and accelerated swiftly in the middle overs. At the halfway stage, it looked like RCB were well ahead but that's when things took a drastic turn for the worse. Andre Russell got rid of both set batters in the same over and RCB ended up throwing a couple more wickets away in the next over bowled by Narine.</p>",

That's how the game goes at times. Then the partnership, it was magnificent (on the Jacks-Patidar partnership), but when you don't win too many games, some sort of panic sets in and the Narine over was game-changing. You don't feel that you have time to settle down and bat (on the evolution of the IPL this season), the game doesn't allow it to do that, obviously you have an extra batter, but in chases like these, you have to keep going. The match-up against Narine, I thought that was the game changing over. The small things, I am actually proud of the boys tonight, the way we bowled and fielded, we did give away a couple of big overs towards the end, but I thought we kept them down to a par score. We thought we'll go hard in the batting powerplay, find those boundaries at the start of the innings. We were desperate, 10/10 from an effort perspective, the way we put up the effort in the ground, the faces told the story. We've got an unbelievable fanbase, we want to make them happy, we want them to have a smile on their face. We'll have to continue putting in our efforts and try to change things around.</p>",
