He got greedy after the sixer and wanted to inside out but failed to find the gap. Hit it straight to the fielder. Was a loopy delivery well wide outside off and Riyan Parag fell for the bait. Mishra has preyed like that before and once again has another one. LSG turning this game around. <b>Riyan Parag c Ayush Badoni b Mishra 14(11) [6s-1]</b> </p>",

Someone as good as Bishnoi ended up bowling only one over. This after LSG fought back towards the end of the powerplay when they picked up three wickets for a few runs. Buttler and Jaiswal started off on fast lanes which eased the pressure at the start. But post the three wickets that went down, Samson and Dhruv Jurel took charge.

In these sorts of games, the set batter had to score close to a hundred after getting to 50-60. I think we were 150 after about 15 overs, should have capitalized on it a bit more. I think it is clear the team with more sixes ends up winning. We do try to hit our sixes but today we had to change our approach after those two early wicket. If Hooda pushed on and scored 20 more, and I got 20 more then we\u2019d finish around 220. That would have been the difference, that\u2019s the 20 runs we left behind. We\u2019re seeing with every game how important it is to give the bowlers that extra cushion because they are under the pump. Everyone loves range hitting and hitting it all over the park, we are no different. It is part of the prep. Our big hitters are Stoin and Pooran who can hit those big shots. The other guys like us try to pick our areas and time the shots better. (On Mishra and Bishnoi) There is a bit of chat before the game with the numbers and how opposition players match-up. Mishra is an experienced player and today was a day we knew he could be useful with how slow he bowls and with the larger boundaries. Once the runs kept flowing, they put pressure on our bowlers. There were 2-3 overs when Krunal bowled really well and squeezed them but then they attacked the fast bowlers. I couldn\u2019t get a good time to get Bishnoi, wanted to keep him for the backend when Rovman and Hetmyer came out to bat because we know he can bowl well to them.</p>",

The guys who came in and bowl one over in the power-play do an important job. There has been a lot of planning behind the scenes. The start and the end of the innings was good. We gave away a few in the middle overs. Form is temporary in this format. We have seen Jurel in Tests. We believe in him. He has been batting one hour and two hours at times in the nets. We have been doing really well. We have been a little lucky as well. We need to keep the process right. At the team meetings, we talk about ticking the processes. One game at a time for us.</p>",

One of those rare teams who have been superb away from home. LSG came into this on the back of two excellent wins against CSK but they have been stopped. And that too at home. RR with this win have booked one of the top four places for sure. And they still have five more games to go. Speaks volumes about their dominance. Remember, they were finalists in 2022 as well. But given their form in this edition, that one final step might happen! LSG have made it two play-offs and they still look good for another one. But they will have to brush up their execution a little and comeback stronger next time. We will comeback again as well. But our team of <b>Pradeep Krishnamurthy, Saurabh Shankar, Siva and Kumar Abhisekh Das</b> wishes you good bye for the day! Ciao...</p>",
