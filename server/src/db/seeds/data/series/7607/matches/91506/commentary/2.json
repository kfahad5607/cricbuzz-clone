Marcus Stoinis was the hero of the night with that stunning innings but don't forget Ruturaj Gaikwad played a breathatking innings and got a century of his own earlier. Lots of great cricket played tonight and it came down to just a few poor deliveries and a couple of misfields from CSK. So that win takes LSG up to 4th place while CSK slip down one place to 5th. That's it from us tonight then, this is <b>Anurag Hegde</b> signing off on behalf of <b>Saurabh Shankar</b> and<b> Praveen Kumar. </b></p>",

It\u2019s not just go go go, there were some bowlers we wanted to target and some bowlers we wanted to be more cautious against. There was a phase where I wasn\u2019t able to hit the boundaries so it was great Pooran could come in and take the pressure off. Lots of ebbs and flows, just tried to keep it in control. You\u2019re planning and structuring, you're not liking certain bowlers and you\u2019re liking others more. I do think T20 cricket is changing, the scores that have been scored, the impact player role and how teams are taking on the bowlers. I\u2019ve got a great relationship with the coach (Australian Head coach), me not getting a contract, I knew that long ago. It\u2019s great to let the kids come in and get an opportunity, I\u2019m happy to let them take my spot. But on the playing front, I\u2019d like to play and contribute.</p>",

It was a fresh start, both teams started off at 0. Different conditions here. I think they started off really well and put us under pressure. 170-180 would\u2019ve been a great total here but they batted really well. Full credit to Stoinis. It was not just power hitting, it was very clever batting. He picked his bowlers and played very well. (On sending Stoinis at 3) We felt like we needed to be braver and capitalize the powerplay and needed 1 power-hitter in the top-3. I\u2019ve realized that T20 cricket has changed in the past couple of years, 170-180 doesn\u2019t always cut it. You need to go harder in the powerplay and the impact player rule also gives you a bit more depth. (On the change to his own batting) Haven't played much T20 cricket so happy that it\u2019s coming off. There\u2019s no set plan, apart from the openers, everyone else is ready to go out whenever we feel it's right. We\u2019re going to keep it flexible. (On his catch earlier) Not bad, not bad\u2026 I hope I get the catch of the tournament award (smiles), I was just being modest.</p>",

He'd shown no real signs of being in this kind of form before tonight but when push came to shove, Stoinis stood tall and got the job done. Chasing 211, a score Shivam Dube said was about 10-15 above par, LSG got off to a poor start as they lost both openers early. It was a brutal struggle for Padikkal who came in next and LSG were firmly behind the asking rate even as Stoinis struck them cleanly from one end. Interestingly though, LSG's innings followed nearly the same trajectory as CSK's. The acceleration came right when LSG needed it as Stoinis and Pooran teed off. Pathirana got CSK back in the fold with the wicket of Pooran but the CSK bowlers, with plenty of dew out there, simply couldn't batten the hatches against Stoinis' assault. They were hurt by a couple of crucial misfields from Deepak Chahar as well and a little cameo from Deepak Hooda only aided the cause. With 17 needed off the last over, Stoinis got it done with 3 deliveries to spare. Presentations coming up shortly.</p>",
