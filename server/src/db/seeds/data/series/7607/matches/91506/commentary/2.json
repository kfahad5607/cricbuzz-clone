He'd shown no real signs of being in this kind of form before tonight but when push came to shove, Stoinis stood tall and got the job done. Chasing 211, a score Shivam Dube said was about 10-15 above par, LSG got off to a poor start as they lost both openers early. It was a brutal struggle for Padikkal who came in next and LSG were firmly behind the asking rate even as Stoinis struck them cleanly from one end. Interestingly though, LSG's innings followed nearly the same trajectory as CSK's. The acceleration came right when LSG needed it as Stoinis and Pooran teed off. Pathirana got CSK back in the fold with the wicket of Pooran but the CSK bowlers, with plenty of dew out there, simply couldn't batten the hatches against Stoinis' assault. They were hurt by a couple of crucial misfields from Deepak Chahar as well and a little cameo from Deepak Hooda only aided the cause. With 17 needed off the last over, Stoinis got it done with 3 deliveries to spare. Presentations coming up shortly.</p>",

I don't have any option, the run-rate was like that, these guys was tough to handle, that's what IPL brings. He was too good and he was like a warrior, he was there from the 2nd over, his knock was motivation only. 100% we were in the game and the dugout was sure that we are gonna fight and win the game. These 2 points make a big difference to our team and we are in the business end of the tournament, against CSK who are playing well. It is a good feeling.</p>",

It was a fresh start, both teams started off at 0. Different conditions here. I think they started off really well and put us under pressure. 170-180 would\u2019ve been a great total here but they batted really well. Full credit to Stoinis. It was not just power hitting, it was very clever batting. He picked his bowlers and played very well. (On sending Stoinis at 3) We felt like we needed to be braver and capitalize the powerplay and needed 1 power-hitter in the top-3. I\u2019ve realized that T20 cricket has changed in the past couple of years, 170-180 doesn\u2019t always cut it. You need to go harder in the powerplay and the impact player rule also gives you a bit more depth. (On the change to his own batting) Haven't played much T20 cricket so happy that it\u2019s coming off. There\u2019s no set plan, apart from the openers, everyone else is ready to go out whenever we feel it's right. We\u2019re going to keep it flexible. (On his catch earlier) Not bad, not bad\u2026 I hope I get the catch of the tournament award (smiles), I was just being modest.</p>",

You\u2019re planning and structuring, you're not liking certain bowlers and you\u2019re liking others more.
