    "commText": "<p><b>Preview:</b> \\n \\nHaving suffered three consecutive losses, Mumbai Indians are in a dire need of a victory. History, though, tells us that they've overcome worse starts to a season and still clinched the championship. For instance, in the 2015 edition, despite enduring reversals in their first four games, and losing five out of the initial six matches, they eventually ended up lifting the title. \\n \\nThe same, though, is unlikely to be said of Ishan Kishan (4, 34, 16), one of the batting mainstays of Mumbai Indians. With Rishabh Pant (18, 28, 51 and 55) and Sanju Samson (82 not out, 15 and 12) - Kishan's perceived competitors - registering strong performances in the season, the MI stumper could be feeling the heat to secure his place in the squad for the upcoming 2024 T20 World Cup. The national selectors are expected to watch the first half of the league before picking the team for the ICC event. \\n \\nKishan had stirred a controversy a few months ago by locking himself from the cricket world and refusing to take part in domestic cricket despite express instructions from the selectors and the BCCI. However, the live images of him conversing with BCCI secretary Jay Shah, apparently in a friendly way after an IPL game recently, suggested that all is well between him and the BCCI. \\n \\nHowever with no meaty scores to back his case, Kishan, one of the key wicketkeeper-batters in the country who was also part of last year's World Cup squad, he may be facing a race against time. Kishan spent a long time at the team nets on Saturday afternoon at the Wankhede, trying to clear the fence. With Pant in the other team, it will be a contest within the contest between them on Sunday afternoon. \\n \\nThe match will be as much about Kishan and Pant as much about Suryakumar Yadav. The prolific batter, who led India not too long ago in South Africa, was last seen in action in December. His return to action, after more than 100 days of hiatus, will be eagerly welcomed by the winless Mumbai Indians side. His return could mean that Naman Dhir, who has impressed with his stroke-making, may come in as an Impact Player. \\n \\nSourav Ganguly, meanwhile, backed the beleaguered MI captain, Hardik Pandya, who has been facing hostility from the crowd after he was appointed skipper in place of Rohit Sharma. \"I don't think they (crowd) should boo Pandya. It's not correct. The franchisee has appointed him as captain. Obviously Rohit Sharma is a different class. But then it's not a hard thing for all, that he has (Pandya) been appointed as captain. I think all of us need to understand,\" Ganguly said. \\n \\n<b>When:</b> Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitas, IPL 2024, April 7, 15:30 IST \\n \\n<b>Where:</b> Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai \\n \\n<b>What to expect:</b> The teams are at the bottom of the points table and will obviously be looking to go up on the ladder. It will be a keen contest with the Wankhede pitch assisting the batsmen. It being an afternoon game, the dew will not be a factor which means toss will not be that much crucial \\n \\n<b>Head to Head:</b> MI 18 - 15 DC. Mumbai also have a better record against the Delhi side in recent times, leading them by 6:3 since 2020. Last year, Mumbai Indians had won the only match between them. \\n \\n<b>Team Watch:</b> \\n \\n<b>Mumbai Indians</b> \\n \\n<b>Injury/Availability:</b> Mumbai Indians have full strength for the game with Suryakumar Yadav back in the mix. \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> It is obvious that Surya will be available for the game which means Naman Dhir could come as an Impact player. MI might use Jasprit Bumrah for at least two overs in the power play so that they can attack opener David Warner, their highest scorer of the season so far. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Hardik Pandya (c), Rohit Sharma, Dewald Brevis, Jasprit Bumrah, Piyush Chawla, Gerald Coetzee, Tim David, Ishan Kishan (wk), Akash Madhwal, Kwena Maphaka, Suryakumar Yadav. Substitute: Naman Dhir. \\n \\n<b>Delhi Capitals</b> \\n \\n<b>Injury/Availability:</b> Kuldeep Yadav continues to be doubtful. He needs to clear fitness test. \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> Delhi Capitals may leave out Mitchell Marsh and include compatriot Jake Fraser McGurk, who has the fastest List A hundred. They are handicapped by the by the absence of Kuleep and may use Axar Patel for full quota of four overs, which they did not in their last game, against Kolkata Knight Riders \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Prithvi Shaw, David Warner, Rishabh Pant (c & wk), Tristan Stubbs, Axar Patel, Sumit Kumar, Rasikh Dar Salam, Anrich Nortje, Ishant Sharma, Khaleel Ahmed and Jake Fraser McGurk. Substitute: Abhishek Porel \\n \\n<b>What they said:</b> \\n \\n\"Surya is available. He has joined the camp. I don't know about my selection. It is a management decision. I will prepare for the next game. Right now I don't know about it (selection)\" - <b>Naman Dhir</b> on whether he will be used as an Impact Player in the match \\n \\n\"Mumbai are a good side. We are a good team as well. We've won one game against Chennai. We expect Mumbai to play well because they have been a great franchise over a long period of time. They have some quality players, so you expect them to play well. But T20 is such a format that sometimes you get into this situation where you lose a couple of games and then you have to find a way to get back. So we expect them to play well. This is their home and this is a great cricketing venue in Mumbai. So we expect them to play well and it's going to be a good game tomorrow. We'll compete\" - <b>Sourav Ganguly</b>, DC team director, on Mumbai Indians</p>",

The Capitals have one win from four matches while the Mumbai Indians are the only team to yet register a win this season, having lost all their three matches so far. While RR and KKR sit pretty at 1 and 2, there's a logjam in the middle and it gives an opportunity for both of these two teams to kickstart their faltering campaign. The Capitals were lacklustre\u00a0in their previous match with Ricky Ponting admitting that he was 'embarrassed' by their first half performance. Injuries haven't helped their cause either with Kuldeep Yadav still sitting out. On the other side, Mumbai Indians have not been helped by off-field issues which have threatened\u00a0to derail their campaign this season. On the positive side, they've been bolstered by the arrival of Surya Kumar Yadav and it might not be a surprise if he's drafted into the playing\u00a0XI today.\u00a0</p>",
