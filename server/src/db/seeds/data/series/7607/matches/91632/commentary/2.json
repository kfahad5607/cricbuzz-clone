Kuldeep, too, deserves a special mention as he bowled a game-changing 18th over that saw him pick 2 wickets for just 4 runs.

The RR skipper started walking off and only to return to the middle to have what looked like a heated discussion with the onfield umpires. Meanwhile the Delhi Capitals ownership in the stands lets their emotions out which seem to be suggest that Samson has to go. This was a hit down the ground by Samson. Didn't middle it well enough. Hope was close to the boundary and he made sure he didn't step on the rope despite a couple of wobbly movements at the end. But the replays aren't clear if Hope completed that clean without touching the boundary. Samson was walking off but the RR dugout believes the fielder touched the rope. Oh these two sides. We have seen it before when Pant called his team back at the Wankhede (Powell vs McCoy). We have had this today. But Samson has to go eventually as the third ump is convinced. Big dent this for RR and what a brilliant innings from the captain. <b>Samson c Shai Hope b Mukesh Kumar 86(46) [4s-8 6s-6]</b></p>",
