They've remained unbeaten here since 2015, and today was a particularly emphatic performance from the men in purple. 182 looked like a decent total from the hosts, given that the pitch was on the slower side and it seemed difficult to hit against the older ball. RCB's scoring rate dropped after the powerplay, and the KKR bowlers used their cutters really well, especially the likes of Russell and Harshit Rana. However, when it came to the chase, KKR didn't have to worry too much about the scoring rate against the older ball because Sunil Narine and Phil Salt pretty much killed the game in the powerplay itself. The two of them came out swinging and put RCB's pacers to the sword, with 85 coming off the first six overs. If the game wasn't done there, then it was certainly done when Venkatesh Iyer backed up the openers with a quickfire fifty which completely shut the door on the home team, leaving the crowd dead silent. All in all, it was a night to forget for RCB. Hang around, we'll have the presentations shortly.</p>",

    "commText": "<p><b>Faf du Plessis:</b> Strange one, first innings we thought that the wicket was very two-paced, you could see that when\u00a0the guys bowled the cutters, back of a length, the guys really struggled. We thought it was a decent score knowing that it gets a little bit easier in the evening, there was a little bit of dew that came in. Looking at the way we batted in the first innings, even if you have someone in there, Virat was struggling to hit the ball just because there was lack of pace and the two-paceness. (Could anything have done differently in the powerplay with the ball?) You\u00a0can always know after the game, we can say perhaps try one or two things but the way the two of them (Narine and Slat) were striking the ball, some really good batting there, they put pressure on our bowlers. They hit strong cricket shots and pretty much took the game away. With Narine there, you can't really go to spin, you want to use pace upfront. That's also a really good match-up for Salt and the way he plays. They were excellent, really broke the game in the first six overs. We've tried the spinning options with Maxi, the finger-spinners seem be be effective here, but at night there wasn't too much spin, With left-hand, right-hand combination, it's one of those things, you can bowl a spinner. But as you saw when Venky was playing against the left-arm spinner, you feel like it's an easy hit on a small boundary to hit with the spin. Ideally you want someone who can spin the ball both ways but with the set-up of our team tonight, we didn't have that option. (On Vyshak) Very good, he hasn't had opportunities. We had a look in the first innings and we thought about bringing in Karn Sharma. But we felt someone who could bowl really good slower balls is probably the most difficult bowler to face on this pitch. Dre Russ probably bowled 80% of his balls cutters. We took some learnings from that and he was the best bowler of the evening.</p>",

To be honest, it got better as the game went on, one end in particular, the Pavilion end and credit to Narine, the pressure was off and we had to go and finish the formalities. It was very important to capitalise on the platform laid, the left-arm spinner was bowling and it was my duty to go after the bowling. Also my fiancee is here and I would like to credit her. Vyshak bowled really well, used the change-ups nicely. To face him was a little tough, pace off on that pitch in totality was tough. even when we bowled quick deliveries, it was tough.</p>",

Coming and hitting few balls, it felt comfortable from within. The way Russell came in and realised the wicket wasn't giving much for bowlers, and went to slower ones, analysing the conditions on the spot was pleasing to the eye. The communication was brilliant. See when Narine comes in to open, he knows he has one job which is to clear the infield. Today we were contemplating whether to start with him or not but he did a brilliant job. From one end, it was good to bat on. From the other end it was two paced. That was the communication we had in the middle and we passed it onto others. Would be spending a day tomorrow in Bangalore, and then go to Vizag. I'm not expecting much at this point of time - it's just the start of the tournament.
