    "commText": "<p><b>Shikhar Dhawan:</b> It was a good game, we brought the game back and again we lost it. We scored 10-15 runs less, in the first six overs I played a bit slow. Those 10-15 runs cost us and the dropped catch as well. (Turning point) Virat scored 70-odd runs and we dropped a catch of the class player, we paid the price. If we had taken that catch, the momentum would have come from the second ball. But we lost the momentum over there and then we paid the price for that. It looked good but it wasn't a very true wicket, it was stopping, bit of double bounce and turned as well. 70% coming good, 30% it was doing a bit. I am happy with my runs but I thought I could have played a bit more fast in the first six overs, that's the only thing I felt. We lost wickets as well, we lost two wickets continuously and that put pressure on us. At the end, that's the total we thought on this wicket. The match went till the last over, at the end also we could have bowled a bit better. (On Harpreet Brar) He's bowling really well, especially bowling against left-handers, tremendous the way he soaked in the pressure and got us the breakthroughs. It's a very big thing in Punjab, the Kabaddi thing, the people really connect with that thigh-five, happy to see him do it.</p>",

Even 30 off 2 overs becomes a reality. Really pleased for him (DK). I said it the other night - really important for him to get his IPL going with confidence. That sets you up for the rest of the tournament. We need him with his experience. There's obviously a plan - from the auction - to find some sort of DNA that would work at home. It is a tough place to find out what the DNA is. It is a unique ground. Even tonight the pitch was a bit different in the sense that it wasn't a fast and bouncy pitch, and a flat pitch. Virat was important in the way he tempoed his innings. Wasn't a pitch where you could hit through the line. Good to see him, he's always smiling and enjoying himself. Still very passionate about playing cricket. Obviously had a nice break now which is very important. He's still enjoying himself, very passionate about playing cricket.

But when you look back it's the memories you create. Rahul bhai in the change room says the same nowadays. When you play, play your heart out because you're going to miss these times. The love, appreciation and backing I've received has been amazing. I try to give the team a blazing start, but if wickets fall, you have to understand the conditions as well. Wasn't the usual placid pitch. It was a bit two-paced. And I thought I need to play correct cricketing shots. Playing across the line wasn't working. Disappointed I couldn't finish the game. Was in the slot but sliced it to deep point. Not a bad start - playing after two months and getting into the tournament. They know I play the cover drive well, so they're not going to allow me to hit gaps. With guys like KG and Arshdeep hitting length, you have to create some momentum with the ball. Once you're closer to the ball, you negate the bounce and meet it earlier. You have to come up with a game plan here and there. <b>I know my name is now attached to just promoting the game in different parts of the world when it comes to T20 cricket. But I've still got it I guess.</b> We were not in the country (talking about his break). We were in a place where people were not recognising us. Just time together as a family, just to feel normal for two months - for me, my family - it was a surreal experience. Of course having two kids, things become totally different from a family perspective. Just the ability to be together, the connections you make with your older child. Couldn't have been more grateful to God for the opportunity to spend time with the family. It's an amazing experience to just be another person on the road and not be recognised. That's the promise I can give here - I'll keep turning up and keep trying me best.</p>",
