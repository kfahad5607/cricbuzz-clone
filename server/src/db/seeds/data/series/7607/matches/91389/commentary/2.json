With 39 needed off the last two overs, Natarajan conceded a couple of boundaries but the left-arm pacer nailed a couple of yorkers to give away just 10 runs off the penultimate over. The final over turned out to be an eventful one - three dropped catches (two of them palmed over the ropes), three wides and three sixes. I0$</p>",

Bhuvi removed Prabhsminran and Dhawan in his following two overs which resulted in Punjab registering the lowest powerplay total of the season (27/3). Curran struck a few boundaries and looked to take the attack to the SRH bowlers but his knock was cut short by Natarajam, courtesy a superb catch from Cummins. Raza perished while playing a premeditated scoop shot. Jitesh couldn't make a notable contribution. Post that, Shashank-Ashutosh duo smashed 66 runs off just 27 balls to take their team so close to the target.</p>",

When the wicket wasn't offering a lot of bounce, every individual will have to look back and change their approach. We dropped a catch off the last ball, we could have kept them down by 10-15 runs, but batting let us down. It's great to see youngsters chipping in with such consistency (on Shashank and Ashutosh). There was always hope that they could finish the game, but we got so close and that'll give us confidence going into the future games, but we'll have to do better going ahead.</p>",

It depends on how you prepare, it is about keeping the same things and keeping it simple, everyone knows what I am going to do and I know what the batters are going to do.

We knew that the new ball was going to be key. We were pretty happy to get to 180. Maybe conditions (on him taking the new ball), didn't think I was going to do that coming into the game. We saw what happened with the new ball for them. Bhuvi and I started off, tried to take a couple\u00a0of wickets. Beauty is we've got plenty of left-armers, right-armers, so you just try and give them the best chance of success. (On Nitish) He was awesome, fantastic, debuted last week.
