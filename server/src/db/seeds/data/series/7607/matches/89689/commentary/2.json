Personally felt, Rachin batted brilliantly in the powerplay and took the game away. From there we were always ahead. [on Dube] In terms of confidence, the management and Mahi bhai worked with him personally, his confidence is very high. He knows his roles very well. Definitely he is a big plus for us. I'm impressed with the fielding as well. Maybe one or two youngsters we have extra this year and great effort from Jinks, even in the last game he was running from one end to the\u00a0other. Fielding is a big tick for us.\u00a0</p>",

In T20 you can always talk about 10-15 runs here or there, end of the day it\u2019s about how much they got. On this wicket, we were expecting to chase 190-200. I think it\u2019s a great learning for the bowlers. I think it\u2019s better to have this kind of game early on in the tournament rather than in the middle or late.
