    "commText": "<p><b>Preview</b> \\n \\nIrrespective of how busy the doctors in the <b>Delhi Capitals'</b> team have been and how short of options the team management has been in finding ideal combinations, somehow, just past the mid-way stage of their IPL 2024 campaign, they find themselves equal on points with <b>Kolkata Knight Riders,</b> the two-time IPL-winning franchise going through possibly their most dominant league-stage run. \\n \\nIt's a different matter that the <b>Shreyas Iyer</b>-led side has two extra games at hand, but they will be smart enough to not take this challenge against the bruised DC lightly. They have seen DC give them a tough fight the last time the two sides met and KKR had posted a total upwards of 270. With the next game also promising to be a run-fest, PBKS have given them another reminder that no matter how many runs they pile on, it may not be enough. \\n \\nUnlike KKR, DC lack depth in their batting and are far from having the most imposing bowling attack either. But somehow they have managed to eke out wins in the last few games. And even the one they lost - against SRH - was a contest that they allowed to slip away from their grasp. \\n \\nIt promises to be an interesting run to the finish of the league stage, and both DC and KKR are in no position to let their guards down at the moment. \\n \\n<b>When:</b> Monday, <b>April 29, 2023, 7:30 PM IST</b> \\n \\n<b>Where:</b> Kolkata Knight Riders vs Delhi Capitals, IPL 2024, Eden Gardens, Kolkata \\n \\n<b>What to expect:</b> Records have been broken and runs have flowed. The two teams played out a run-fest previously this season in <b>Visakhapatnam,</b> and it's unlikely that there could be anything else in the sultry climes of Eden Gardens \\n \\n<b>Team Watch</b> \\n \\n<b>Kolkata Knight Riders:</b> \\n \\n<b>Injuries/unavailability:</b> It remains unclear if <b>Mitchell Starc</b> will be available for the game \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> DC may have the best spin duo in the competition, but <b>Shreyas Iyer</b> has taken apart <b>Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel</b> quite effectively in the past. The KKR skipper could have an important role to play in the middle overs. Similarly, <b>Varun Chakravarthy</b> has managed to keep it tight against <b>Tristan Stubbs</b> in the past and dismissed <b>Rishabh Pant</b> twice in 28 balls. His role will be important in the middle overs alongside <b>Sunil Narine</b> \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Kolkata Knight Riders: Sunil Narine, Phil Salt, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Shreyas Iyer, Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Dushmantha Chameera/Mitchell Starc, Varun Chakravarthy <b>Impact Substitute: Vaibhav Arora</b> \\n \\n<b>Delhi Capitals:</b> \\n \\n<b>Injuries/unavailability:</b> <b>David Warner and Ishant Sharma</b> are unlikely to be available for the game. Doubts also persist over <b>Prithvi Shaw's</b> availability \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> <b>Andre Russell</b> has struggled to pick <b>Kuldeep Yadav's</b> variations well in the past and DC could be tempted to use their left-arm spinner against the big-hitting West Indian. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abhisek Porel, Shai Hope, Rishabh Pant, Tristan Stubbs, Kumar Kushagra, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Anrich Nortje/Lizaad Williams, Khaleel Ahmed, Mukesh Kumar, [/b]Impact Sub: Rasikh Salam[/b] \\n \\n<b>What they said:</b> \\n \\nHe <b>Fraser-McGurk</b> has been amazing since the first day and this is what you want from a younger player, he's getting better and better with each game. The chances (of making it to the playoffs) are increasing day by day, but we are taking it one game at a time - <b>Rishabh Pant, DC captain</b> \\n \\nWe have to sum up the conditions and come up with better ideas. It is brilliant to see him <b>Narine</b> go out there and strike the ball, hopefully he keeps continuing with such performances - <b>Shreyas Iyer, KKR captain</b></p>",

It's No. 2 on the table KKR taking on No. 6 Delhi Capitals, but the interesting thing is that both these teams have the same number of points. The table is so tight that every result will bring about big fluctuations in the order, and Capitals could leapfrog the hosts if they continue their upward surge which has seen them win four of their last five games. A big part of their success has been the introduction of Jake Fraser-Mcgurk who has taken the IPL by storm with three blistering fifties - two of which have come off just 15 balls. What will he do at a venue where a target of 262 was chased down successfully in the previous match here?</p>",
