Had some time to reflect and refresh, spend a bit more time with the family, wasn't putting as much onus on the training time but more the stuff I was doing in the gym, in the physical side and the mental side of the game. Really good place at the moment. Got the family over here - mum and dad, wife and child who are still here supporting me which is great. Looking forward to having a little bit of success at the back end of this tournament. The hard thing about being on the road going from tournament to tournament is the adaptability\u00a0that you have to have. It's a busy year but I am so grateful to have the support from them the whole way through. (Approach with the bat) Hopefully it's the same as the other night where I don't have to bat (chuckles), but I have been really confident with the stuff that I have been\u00a0doing at training, I don't think that's changed too much. My mindset hasn't quite been as clear as it has been in the past and that can happen when you are striving for runs. You feel like you are in good form at the start of the tournament and you try too hard to get your innings going without worrying about the process at the start. Focusing on that, making sure that I am sticking to my strengths and sticking to what makes me a successful player.</p>",

    "commText": "<p><b>Preview</b> by <b>Kaushik Rangarajan</b> \\n \\nA lot can change in a short time in the IPL. This time last year, Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Gujarat Titans squared off at the Chinnaswamy Stadium under very different circumstances. The Titans were toppers and already in the playoffs. RCB were a win away from making it four straight years in the final-four, their fate very much at home, which as it turned out was not the best place it could be. \\n \\nSnap to the present and Saturday's contest is one between teams placed eighth and tenth. While the qualification flame hasn't been doused for either team, progress from here is now a function of several variables, including form. In that regard, RCB are slightly better placed with two wins on the bounce and a clearer game plan involving front-loading their overseas batters/all-rounders. A third straight win and a double over the Titans will lift Faf du Plessis' side from the points-table floor, where they've spent the majority of this season. \\n \\nGujarat, on the other hand, seek an upturn at the top. They are the slowest scoring team in the PowerPlays, but also don't lose many wickets which means they haven't effectively maximised the batting depth with Rashid Khan bating at No.8. The end of this fixture last year was viewed in some quarters as a seminal changing of the guard in Indian cricket when Shubman Gill responded to a Virat Kohli 100 with a ton of his own. A year on, there's no place for the Titans skipper in a World Cup squad with the old guard proving to be resilient. \\n \\nGill's 19-ball 16 in last Sunday's clash between these sides in Ahmedabad felt like a particular low point in a middling season for the star batter-captain, the downturn mirroring that of his franchise. The team management, however, firmly remains in his corner and believes that captaincy will eventually get the best out of him. Interestingly, his tally of 320 so far is only 55 runs short of where he was at, at this stage in his stellar IPL 2023 campaign. Form, like weather, can be fickle. And as Bengaluru has shown in the last two days, a lot can change in a short time. \\n \\n<b>When: </b>Royal Challengers Bengaluru vs Gujarat Titans, IPL 2024, May 4, 19.30 IST \\n \\n<b>Where: </b>M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru \\n \\n<b>What to expect: </b>It's been nearly 20 days since SRH and RCB plundered 549 runs in the last game here. After a string of games with slightly lower scores, the 'refreshed' Chinnaswamy Stadium pitch could signal a return to IPL 2024 norm. After months of scorching summer heat, Bengaluru rejoiced in the gloom of the last two days. There is no forecast of a rain-enforced interruption on match day. \\n \\n<b>Head to Head: </b>RCB 2-2 GT. The Royal Challengers comprehensively chased down 200 with four overs to spare in last week's reverse fixture in Ahmedabad. All four games between these sides have been won by the chasing team. \\n \\n<b>Team Watch:</b> \\n \\n<b>Royal Challengers Bengaluru</b> \\n \\n<b>Injuries/Availability: </b>Glenn Maxwell returned from his break in the previous fixture and remains available for selection. \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> \\n \\nMohammmed Siraj has dismissed David Miller twice and conceded just 10 runs from the 14 balls bowled at the left-hander. They are likely to face off in the death overs, where the RCB man currently holds the edge over the destructive Titans finisher. \\n \\nRCB are likely to continue using an all-Indian bowling attack and play both their overseas all-rounders. Vijaykumar Vyshak, who has bowled well on his home ground, could come in as the impact substitute and provide additional bowling cushion. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI: </b>Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Will Jacks, Rajat Patidar, Glenn Maxwell, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Swapnil Singh, Karn Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Yash Dayal [Impact Subs: Mahipal Lomror/Vijaykumar Vyshak] \\n \\n<b>Gujarat Titans</b> \\n \\n<b>Injuries/Availability:</b> \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups: </b>Spencer Johnson's left-arm angle can be a useful proposition against a right-heavy RCB top-order. He can also be used to counter the back-in-form Rajat Patidar, who is striking spin at 225 compared to a measly 127.12 against the faster bowlers. The quicks have also dismissed Patidar six times in seven innings, with left-armers accounting for two of those dismissals. \\n \\nWriddhiman Saha had a long net session on the eve of the match but one possible tweak for GT could involve swapping out the veteran 'keeper for Matthew Wade. If GT consider such a move, they could bench the overseas all-rounder Omarzai for Vijay Shankar, who had a great game here in 2023. Given GT are adequately stocked in the spin department, they could also look to swap their third spinner, Noor Ahmad, for Johnson in keeping with teams' preferring for pace (31 wickets at 10.47 ER) over spin (11 wickets at 9.25 ER) at this venue. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI: </b>Shubman Gill (c), Wriddhiman Saha/Matthew Wade (wk), Sai Sudharsan, Azmatullah Omarzai/Vijay Shankar, Shahrukh Khan, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, R. Sai Kishore, Sandeep Warrier, Noor Ahmad/Spencer Johnson, Mohit Sharma [Impact Sub: Darshan Nalkande] \\n \\n<b>Did you know? </b> \\n \\n- In four games against GT, Virat Kohli has scored 58(53), 73(53), 101*(61) and 70*(44) \\n \\n- Since his debut in 2021, no batter scores faster against wrist spin than Rajat Patidar (SR: 219) \\n \\n- Rashid Khan has only 8 wickets after 10 games, his lowest tally in the IPL at this stage. Last year, he had 18 at this stage. \\n \\n<b>What they said:</b> \\n \\n\"It's definitely something I'm adapting to. I started doing it in November last year in the Caribbean for England. It's obviously different. The hardest thing I found is coming in outside the PowerPlay. You get a few to have a look at, you get a few easy boundaries and get yourself rolling. But outside the PowerPlay, you have to make the play yourself and it's harder to be 17-18 off 10 balls. So I think it's more of a mental thing... It's about what I can do best to help the team's chances from this position. It's something I'm getting better at.\" - Will Jacks, on his role at No.3 after predominantly playing as an opener in other competitions.</p>",
