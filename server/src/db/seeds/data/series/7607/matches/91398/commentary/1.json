He literally toyed with Akash Madhwal and gave him a night to forget as he pasted him to all corners of the ground. Before this game, Kohli was the only batter to get past 50 for RCB this season and this game saw 3 other batters (Faf, Patidar and DK) do it. All three special and unique in its own way. Can RCB take all this positivity and I0$ into their bowling? Back shortly for the reply...</p>",
