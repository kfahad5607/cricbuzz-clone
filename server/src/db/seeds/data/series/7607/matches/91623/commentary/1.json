It might not be amongst the obnoxiously high totals we've gotten used to but this surface isn't a highway either. After being asked to bat first, SRH started well enough in the powerplay. The opening partnership was worth 56 and while Abhishek Sharma struggled tonight, Travis Head carted them around after getting a couple of reprieves - first getting bowled off a no-ball and then getting dropped. But it was after the powerplay that the trouble started for SRH. Mumbai bowled really well through the middle overs and kept picking up wickets at regular intervals. Both Hardik and Piyush Chawla were instrumental in that stage and both ended up with 3 wickets each. SRH were 125/7 at the end of the 16th over but a lovely cameo from Cummins (35* off 17) meant that MI weren't quite able to contain the opposition to a cheap total. The wicket seemed to be slightly two-paced and it held up on occasions so if SRH bowl well, they're definitely in with a chance. Back shortly.</p>",

This season, batters go for it if they see the ball a little pitched up even if they are new to the crease - I didn't realise that in the first few matches, but got the idea later about what length to bowl. 173 isn't going to be that easy, we'll still have to bat well. No, there's hardly anything for spinners in this wicket.</p>",
