    "commText": "<p><b>Preview</b> \\n \\nDespite being masters of the run chase, it's no secret that the Gujarat Titans top order is heavily reliant on Shubman Gill. Especially at a time when they struggle to fit in Kane Williamson because of their overseas conundrum, the onus is on Gill to deliver almost every single game. From that standpoint, it isn't a coincidence that they have had an erratic campaign up until now. \\n \\nFor a player who looked like he would threaten Virat Kohli's 973-run tally last year, Gill has hit only two fifties in nine matches so far in IPL 2024. He has also been dismissed for a single-digit score thrice already and this has happened in a season where the batters have made merry like never before in the history of this competition. Gill has already appeared to have fallen below the pecking order for a spot in the Indian squad ahead of the T20 World Cup. With only five matches remaining in the league stages, his fortunes have to change for his own sake and also from a Titans' perspective. \\n \\nFor the Royal Challengers Bengaluru, it is all about remaining determined to topple another side after that first class performance against Sunrisers Hyderabad. They had the challenge of getting rid of those marauding openers early in the powerplay and completed that task to perfection. If they can pull it off again, Titans will feel the heat. This will be a huge test for Virat Kohli as well who came under the scanner once again for slowing down post the powerplay against the spinners. He will have to contend with the likes of Rashid Khan, Noor Ahmed and Sai Kishore this time. \\n \\n<b>When:</b> April 28 at 15:30 IST \\n \\n<b>Where:</b> Gujarat Titans vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad \\n \\n<b>What to expect:</b> In a tournament where the scores are skyrocketing, we saw Titans get shot out for just 89 in front of their home crowd in the last game here. They would certainly not want a similar surface this time. \\n \\n<b>Head to Head:</b> Gujarat Titans 2 - Royal Challengers Bengaluru 1 \\n \\n<b>Team Watch</b> \\n \\n<b>Gujarat Titans</b> \\n \\n<b>Injuries/Availability:</b> Titans do not have any new injury concerns. \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> Introducing Rashid Khan quite early inside the powerplay might not be a bad ploy for the Titans. Rashid has dismissed Faf du Plessis thrice and Virat Kohli twice in the IPL so far. Gill might not be in form at the moment but he has an excellent record against Siraj that can potentially help him regain his touch. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill (c), David Miller, Azmatullah Omarzai, Rahul Tewatia, Shahrukh Khan, Rashid Khan, R Sai Kishore, Noor Ahmad, Mohit Sharma, Sandeep Warrier [Impact Sub: Sai Sudharsan] \\n \\n<b>Royal Challengers Bengaluru</b> \\n \\n<b>Injuries/Availability:</b> With Will Jacks and Cameron Green getting amongst the runs recently, Glenn Maxwell's self-imposed exile is likely to continue. \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> While the focus will be on Kohli against the spin trio, RCB would want Rajat Patidar to be on strike for the major part against spin. This season against the spinners, his strike rate is a stunning 225 at an average of 67. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Will Jacks, Rajat Patidar, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Mahipal Lomror, Karn Sharma, Lockie Ferguson, Mohammed Siraj, Yash Dayal \\n \\n<b>Did you know?</b> \\n \\n- Virat Kohli's strike rate against pace in IPL 2024 is 162.57. However, against spin it drops down to 123.58. \\n \\n- Mohit Sharma, who had a stellar IPL 2023, is conceding runs at an economy of 11.65 in the death overs in IPL 2024. \\n \\nWhat they said:</p>",

Two teams that are placed in the bottom half of the points table will lock horns at the Narendra Modi Stadium today. The Titans have had a topsy-turvy season having lost five games and won four, while things have been even worse for the Royal Challengers Bangalore. They are placed last in the points table with only two wins in 9 matches. They clinched a rare win against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Thursday but it won\u2019t be a surprise if they continue to struggle for the rest of the season. Such has been the quality of cricket played by the Challengers. Not inspiring at all. Virat Kohli has scored runs but lack of contribution from other batters has resulted in their struggle. Rajat Patidar has played a few impressive knocks in the last few innings, so it will be interesting to see if he continues to make the most of his form. Stay around for the toss and teams.</p>",
