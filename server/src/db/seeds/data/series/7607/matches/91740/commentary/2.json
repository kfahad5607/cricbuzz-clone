Terrific all-round performance throughout the tournament. Four batters with 350+ runs, five bowlers with 17+ wickets. Salt/Gurbaz giving brisk starts at the top, Starc stepping up in the playoffs and the Knight Riders' linchpins - Narine and Russell - being consistent. It wasn't just the overseas players, even the Indian players made vital contributions - Venkatesh Iyer, Varun Chakaravarthy, the uncapped pace duo of Harshit Rana and Vaibhav Arora, Ramandeep's little cameos and his fielding. And, of course, Shreyas Iyer. He came into this competition with a lot of uncertainties but he led KKR to the IPL championship.</p>",

You hope you get a few boundaries away but they bowled fantastically well, didn't really give us anything. Similar to last week in Ahmedabad where they bowled really well, so full credit. It was a bit of a tricky wicket. If we got 160, it would have felt we were in the game. Didn't feel like a 200+ wicket. Well short, maybe a few extra runs would have given us a chance. So many (positives), the style that the the guys played particularly with the bat. Takes a lot of skill to not only get 250 but also three times. It takes real, you are putting yourself out there a fair bit. I loved how brave the guys were. In high-pressure situations, they took the game on. It was a lot of\u00a0fun, fans seemed to like it back in Hyderabad. Great season. It was fantastic, hadn't worked with many of the guys before at all. It was a real pleasure to work with some of the older, experienced guys like Bhuvi. Bhuvi, Nattu, Jaydev were great and lots of young talent throughout. Really great squad, the support staff were amazing, had a great couple of months. We play a lot over here in India but it's normally a sea of blue. It's good having the crowd on our side for once.

We have a great bunch of guys who put out a lot of work throughout the season. The fight they gave throughout the season was very good and it shows how good a team we are. (Batting) Getting the role to just go there and express myself, trying to get the\u00a0team off to a flier, that's key. The backing of the support staff, especially GG just saying - \"go there and enjoy it, just try to win a few games for the team. I am not asking you to do the entire season, but just a few games.\" That was very good advice. Salty played an incredible season. We missed him but Gurbaz came in and filled that role. Once you have an opening partner with the same intent, it's good for the team and you always get a good start for the team as well. He (Varun Chakaravarthy) is a world-class bowler, he puts in the work. Whatever happens on the field, it's what he does off the field.The whole bowling line-up, we always pick early wickets, so we come to bowl under less pressure. As a total bowling unit, picking up wickets is key and it helped us win the title.</p>",

We've had a fantastic squad of bowlers and batters, our staff have been fantastic to get everyone peaking for the back end of the tournament. We've been such a consistent side, we haven't had one or two people standout, it's been contributions from everyone. Great to contribute personally, but the fact we had everyone contribute throughout has been a big part of the success. We lost the toss and got to use the ball first. Having watched the game a few nights ago here, not really sure what the wicket was going to do. We spoke about adapting to the conditions. Shreyas was fantastic with the way he used his bowlers and his fields, has been all season, so credit to him there. The bowling unit showed all the skills they have, the quicks and the spinners, their ability to adapt to find wicket-taking balls. that's what you need in finals. There's been jokes about the money. It's been a long time since I have played the IPL. I am older and an experienced player now, that's helped with managing all the expectations. I am certainly glad I am a bit more experienced and older to deal with all of that. We've got a fantastic squad of players and staff. It's been a lot of fun. Exciting bowling attack.

Varun Chakaravarthy removed Shahbaz and Abdul Samad failed to make an impact. Harshit's slower ball got the better of Klaasen and he bowled a wicket-maiden. Narine was at his miserly best - 4-0-16-1. SRH got skittled out for 113 - lowest total in an IPL final - after opting to bat. In reply, Gurbaz got going with a boundary. Narine fell after smashing a six. Venkatesh Iyer came out all guns blazing - I0$ vs Bhuvi and then I1$ vs Natarajan. Highest powerplay score in an IPL final - 72/1. Venky smashed a 24-ball half-century and hit the winning runs as Kolkata cruised to a 8-wicket win with 57 balls to spare.
