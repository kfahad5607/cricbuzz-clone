The Kolkata pacers started it all by picking up the first four wickets. That set the tone for the spinners and Chakravarthy spun a web around the lower middle order, accounting for Pant, Stubbs and Kushagra while Narine picked up Axar. At 111/8, it seemed like Delhi would be bowled out inside 20 overs but for Kuldeep, he not only showed resistance but also played with positive intent, his knock of 35* has given the visitors a total.
