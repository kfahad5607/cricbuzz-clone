Nobody would have expected this, yes Pant did mention about the pitch being a bit dry and the ball probably holding a bit, but that was supposed to happen in the second innings and not the first. The Kolkata pacers started it all by picking up the first four wickets. That set the tone for the spinners and Chakravarthy spun a web around the lower middle order, accounting for Pant, Stubbs and Kushagra while Narine picked up Axar. At 111/8, it seemed like Delhi would be bowled out inside 20 overs but for Kuldeep, he not only showed resistance but also played with positive intent, his knock of 35* has given the visitors a total. Can their bowlers defend this? Looks unlikey but funny things have happened. Back soon for the chase..</p>",
