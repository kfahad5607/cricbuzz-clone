But Shreyas Iyer held one end up and made his first fifty of the season. Contributions from Rinku and Russell helped KKR as they looked for a 200-plus score. At the end Ramandeep Singh played a blinder and his innings just gave KKR the extra 10-15 runs. For most parts RCB executed very well especially to Narine and Russell. The plans were good from RCB who stuck to it for the majority of the innings and Green was the pick of the bowlers. Will be a stiff chase for RCB. Can they do it? Back for the reply shortly...</p>",

Slow bumpers were not easy to hit, that's what we will do. 222 is a really good score on this pitch, pace on the ball is easy to hit. All credit to Abhishek Nayar, he prepares us this way and all our net sessions resembles a match. We've got a legend in the side in Narine and we will want to watch the legend on show today.</p>",
