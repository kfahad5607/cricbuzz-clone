This is a slightly two-paced surface, the ball came nicely onto the bat with the new ball, but as it became soft, stroke-play became tougher and tougher. It needed a handy cameo from Abdul Samad to ensure that his team went past the 150+ mark. Too many starts, but none of them converted it into anything substantial - Abhishek Sharma's and Samad's 29 was the highest score with all the top-7 batters getting at least 15 or more. Azmatullah bowled three on the trot in the batting PP, Rashid and Noor, his Afghan mates, were excellent in the middle overs and the batters found Mohit hard to get away in the death overs. But SRH have runs on the board and they'll back themselves to defend this. Back for the chase shortly..</p>",

It\u2019s warm but the thing is it\u2019s very dry as well, so it\u2019s going to be tough.
