Once again, it is Riyan Parag who has been their star with the bat, he's really turned a new leaf this season. Showing a lot more responsibility, maturity and ability, the 22-year-old boy has taken Rajasthan home with more than 4 overs to spare!! The game however was set up by their bowlers, as Boult struck thrice in the powerplay, and then Chahal and Burger got amongst the wickets to reduce Mumbai to a total of just 125. In reply, Jaiswal's lean start to the season continued, as he chipped one straight to covers. Samson fell cheaply as well, chopping one onto his stumps against Madhwal, who struck again to dismiss Buttler. RR were a bit shacky at 48/3 but last game's dup of Ashwin and Parag stablised the ship and got the visitors home. A spirited bowling effort from Mumbai, but they were always a few runs short on this ground. Stick on for the captain comments...</p>",

It's okay, we didn't expect such a surface, but you can't always have it as a batter, it's nice at times for the bowlers to have a say. It's all about doing the right things, (correct) results happen at times, at some other times it doesn't.
