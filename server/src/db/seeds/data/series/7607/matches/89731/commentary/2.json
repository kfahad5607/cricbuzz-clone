Showing a lot more responsibility, maturity and ability, the 22-year-old boy has taken Rajasthan home with more than 4 overs to spare!! The game however was set up by their bowlers, as Boult struck thrice in the powerplay, and then Chahal and Burger got amongst the wickets to reduce Mumbai to a total of just 125. In reply, Jaiswal's lean start to the season continued, as he chipped one straight to covers. Samson fell cheaply as well, chopping one onto his stumps against Madhwal, who struck again to dismiss Buttler. RR were a bit shacky at 48/3 but last game's dup of Ashwin and Parag stablised the ship and got the visitors home. A spirited bowling effort from Mumbai, but they were always a few runs short on this ground. Stick on for the captain comments...</p>",

We know we have big individuals in our team, but where we stand out is everyone recognises their role, does it and moves on.

(On Rohit Sharma wicket) I've played against him a lot, and it is just about doing something different against him. Doesn't always work this way, but happy when it does.
