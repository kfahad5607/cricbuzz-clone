Virat and Faf du Plessis played impressive knocks to set the platform and although the pitch was turning square after the rain break, the RCB openers didn't throw their wickets away and put up a fight. Kohli missed out on his fifty as Santner removed him in the 10th over, however, skipper Faf notched up a solid fifty before he was unfortunately run-out at the bowler's end. Patidar and Green had a fabulous partnership thereafter and the pair entertained the crowd to the core. DK and Maxwell played cameos towards the end as RCB finished with 218/5. Like I said before, CSK had a similar target to chase down last year in the final and given their ability to deliver in must-win games, this match is interestingly poised. RCB bowling?

Pretty crazy (on conditions changing after the rain break), Faf and Virat batted beautifully (against spin), gave us a nice little platform, they assessed the conditions well. Don't know why it happened, but it was the same in Dharamsala as well. You can't put a figure on that, it's been the beauty of this season's IPL, it's not about keeping any score in mind, just have to get going and play your shots right from the start.</p>",
