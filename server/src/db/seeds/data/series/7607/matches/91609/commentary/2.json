But as the ball gets older, it doesn't come on very well. When you're playing at a new venue, you don't have an idea of how the pitch will be. Felt we were 15-20 short.

Deshpande was on fire in the powerplay, knocking over Bairstow and Rossouw in the same over while Santner gave nothing away from the other end. CSK have been reluctant to start with spin in the powerplay, but the introduction of Santner today really gave them an added dimension. Punjab Kings did look in with a shot when Prabhsimran and Shashank had a brisk partnership of 53 for the third wicket. Things were evenly poised at that stage. But Jadeja came to the party and bowled a spell of 3/20 to turn the game completely in favour of CSK.
