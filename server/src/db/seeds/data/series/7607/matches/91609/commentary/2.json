Deshpande was on fire in the powerplay, knocking over Bairstow and Rossouw in the same over while Santner gave nothing away from the other end. CSK have been reluctant to start with spin in the powerplay, but the introduction of Santner today really gave them an added dimension. Punjab Kings did look in with a shot when Prabhsimran and Shashank had a brisk partnership of 53 for the third wicket. Things were evenly poised at that stage. But Jadeja came to the party and bowled a spell of 3/20 to turn the game completely in favour of CSK. Simarjeet Singh was impressive as well with his pace through those middle overs, making it a clinical performance with the ball from the visitors.</p>",
