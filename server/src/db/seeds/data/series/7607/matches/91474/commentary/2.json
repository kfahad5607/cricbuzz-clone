Sunrisers Hyderabad have redefined T20 batting with their aggressive approach and it wouldn't be a surprise if they break their own record anytime soon.

Need to keep things simple, need to react to the balls. Very pleased to continue with the same form. He (Abhishek Sharma) plays well in the powerplay. He's aggressive against spin, just let him do his things. Very enjoyable partnership with him. It's hard to pick which guys are going to be the (impact) sub, everyone can bowl and contribute. Nice to have a lot of options, we are able to score such high scores because of so many options available. It has also been difficult for our bowlers in the powerplay, but we did an exceptional job tonight. Just getting back into the swing of things (in the shortest format), nice to be batting top of the order.</p>",

You don\u2019t think much about where the ball is going while bowling in the nets but yes, they give us some nice practice, especially Abhishek and Travis Head.

The ball stopped more in the 2nd innings, that was more than we anticipated, but when we needed to chase 260, 270, you'll need to keep scoring. Hopefully, we'll come up with more thought process and a clear mindset going forward.

The SRH boys smashed (277/3) against MI, they belted RCB by scoring (287/3) at the Chinnaswamy and tonight they posted another massive total (266/7) against the Delhi Capitals. Head, Abhishek and Shahbaz destroyed the bowlers in the first innings as the Sunrisers finished with their third highest total of this season. In reply, Shaw and Warner departed early, however, Fraser McGurk and Porel played entertaining knocks to keep the run chase alive. Once they were dismissed, the boundaries dried up, DC lost momentum and Natarajan came back to clean up DC's tail. He was right on the money with his slower deliveries and yorkers tonight. Kuldeep Yadav claimed four wickets earlier in the evening, however, it was Natarajan's four-wicket haul that proved to be the decisive one. Stay around for the presentations..</p>",
