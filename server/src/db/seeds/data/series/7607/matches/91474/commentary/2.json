The SRH boys smashed (277/3) against MI, they belted RCB by scoring (287/3) at the Chinnaswamy and tonight they posted another massive total (266/7) against the Delhi Capitals. Head, Abhishek and Shahbaz destroyed the bowlers in the first innings as the Sunrisers finished with their third highest total of this season. In reply, Shaw and Warner departed early, however, Fraser McGurk and Porel played entertaining knocks to keep the run chase alive. Once they were dismissed, the boundaries dried up, DC lost momentum and Natarajan came back to clean up DC's tail. He was right on the money with his slower deliveries and yorkers tonight. Kuldeep Yadav claimed four wickets earlier in the evening, however, it was Natarajan's four-wicket haul that proved to be the decisive one. Stay around for the presentations..</p>",

The kind of scores that used to be match-winning totals in the ODI cricket once upon a time. How the tables have turned! Sunrisers Hyderabad have redefined T20 batting with their aggressive approach and it wouldn't be a surprise if they break their own record anytime soon. Will teams manage to come up with different strategies and contain them in near future? Only time has all the answers. For now, it's a goodbye from our side! Good night..</p>",
