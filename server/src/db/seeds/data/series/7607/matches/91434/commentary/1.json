RCB actually began well today with Jacks bowling 2 overs for only 11 runs. But for some reason - sure they would have wanted variety in the attack - they took Jacks off when he was keep it tight and to think it happened right after a Yash Dayal over where Head was put under a bit of pressure with a few dots was hard to understand. SRH's only other LHB was Shahbaz and wonder how saving up Jacks's over were going to help. They missed a potential chance of further troubling an edgy Head by removing Jacks. SRH would have also seen RCB field only four frontline bowlers and tried to take advantage. Anyway, the chase now!</p>",

But you also got to be honest and admit the bowling and strategies weren't great. Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma were given the role of being ultra aggressive in the powerplay and they executed to the T. They scared their opponents as early as the first six overs. Didn't matter who bowled after that start. Abhishek fell early but SRH wanted nothing but a kill today. In walked Klaasen at 3. The agony continued for the hosts. We had balls going deep into the stands, on the roof and even out of the ground. Head got his hundred off 39 balls, Klaasen got his fifty off 23 balls. Markram managed to keep the rate going, but with Klaasen going 277 looked safe. However, Samad put on a mega show in the 19th over to smack Topley for 4 4 6 6 4 and they eventually got the highest IPL total ever.</p>",
