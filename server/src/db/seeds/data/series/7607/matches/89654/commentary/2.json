RCB did very well earlier to post 173 after being in strife at 78/5. It was a fighting total but they would've known that they would have to bowl well because the wicket got a bit better to bat on. CSK's openers got off to a flier and Rachin, in particular, had a debut to remember as he blasted a 15-ball 37. RCB pulled things back slightly in the middle overs and kept things interesting. There was a barrage of short balls and it got them a couple of wickets but they failed to adapt once it stopped working for them. They kept banging it in short while the batters knew exactly what was coming at them. Although Dube was initially uncomfortable, he hung in there and along with Jadeja, got the job done.</p>",

They were always ahead in the chase, we tried to squeeze and get a couple of wickets, but in the end we didn\u2019t have enough runs. On this pitch, it is always better to bat first. Last year, the record was very skewed towards teams that batted first. The ball started to grip a bit with our spinners.
