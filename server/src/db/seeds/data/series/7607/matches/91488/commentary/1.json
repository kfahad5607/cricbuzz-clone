They got off to a good start - adding only their second 50+ opening stand of the season. Prabhsimran was motoring along but perished while playing the big shot, the spinners then came on and put a strangle once the powerplay was done. The spinners bowled 13 overs and returned with figures of 7/75. Sai Kishore being the pick of the bowlers with a 4-fer. Punjab crossed the 140-mark thanks to a cameo from Harpreet Brar, the spinning all-rounder struck a few boundaries to get them to a respectable total, while the other Harpreet struggled and wasted Punjab's impact sub card. The surface is slow and has help for the spinners. But Gujarat Titans should fancy chasing it down. Back soon..</p>",
