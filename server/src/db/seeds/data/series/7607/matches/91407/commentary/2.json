Chasing 167, Delhi didnt get the best of starts as Warner copped a blow to his wrists and then chopped one back onto his stumps. However, that brought the youngster Jake Fraser-McGurk to the crease and he got off the mark with two sixes in the IPL. Fraser-McGurk was well supported by Prithvi Shaw who scored six fours in the powerplay, but holed out trying to attack Ravi Bishnoi. There came a lull post the powerplay as LSG slipped in four quiet overs, with Bishnoi leading the charge. Fraser-McGurk was struggling for timing, and the skipper Rishabh Pant took the mantle on himself. He attacked Bishnoi for a four and six, and that titled the complextion of the game.</p>",

We travel tomorrow and play an afternoon game (on Sunday). That's how the schedule goes, need to turn up, could be tough during Indian summers. In hindsight you can always wonder you could have done something different. There wasn't much spin after Axar's over, so I thought Pooran could have put some pressure on the opposition, if he was set. He would have been dangerous, but credit to Kuldeep for getting him out.

It was more of trying not to swing too hard, trying to find the middle of the bat and that's what I have been trying to do in the last 12 months. I loved the one over cover, nothing better than hitting over the off-side. It is something that I continue to learn and do, batting outside of the powerplay and I will get better by playing more games. I am so happy to be out there, this is a different world out here, heard about it but to experience it.. it is an amazing time to come to India.</p>",

I liked the first and second wicket, I have played a lot against Pooran and the execution for that was right. I was clear with my plans, just the length matters for me as a spinner. Very clear and confident with my skills. Whenever I feel the DRS call is 50/50, I try to push for it but when it is more 60/40 then I tend to listen to Rishabh. As a bowler, you obviously want to take the DRS whevever possible. We've got 2 reviews, so obviously one is for me (laughs off).</p>",
