Chasing 167, Delhi didnt get the best of starts as Warner copped a blow to his wrists and then chopped one back onto his stumps. However, that brought the youngster Jake Fraser-McGurk to the crease and he got off the mark with two sixes in the IPL. Fraser-McGurk was well supported by Prithvi Shaw who scored six fours in the powerplay, but holed out trying to attack Ravi Bishnoi. There came a lull post the powerplay as LSG slipped in four quiet overs, with Bishnoi leading the charge. Fraser-McGurk was struggling for timing, and the skipper Rishabh Pant took the mantle on himself. He attacked Bishnoi for a four and six, and that titled the complextion of the game.</p>",

We travel tomorrow and play an afternoon game (on Sunday). That's how the schedule goes, need to turn up, could be tough during Indian summers. In hindsight you can always wonder you could have done something different. There wasn't much spin after Axar's over, so I thought Pooran could have put some pressure on the opposition, if he was set. He would have been dangerous, but credit to Kuldeep for getting him out.

(On bowling) We have phases where we are not up to the mark, some individuals have to take responsibility for that. However, we stick together as a group. Some things you can control, some things we can't. (On team combination) I think we are getting closer to the right XI, but we've had so many injuries in this group. However, you can't keep complaining about that. (On Fraser-McGurk) Hopefully, we've found our new number 3, haven't thought too much about it. Hope he can continue.</p>",

Credit goes to Patrick (Farhart) to maintain my fitness and get me ready quickly. All three were important wickets, it was crucial to get wickets in the middle overs to control the run rate. I liked the first and second wicket, I have played a lot against Pooran and the execution for that was right. I was clear with my plans, just the length matters for me as a spinner. Very clear and confident with my skills. Whenever I feel the DRS call is 50/50, I try to push for it but when it is more 60/40 then I tend to listen to Rishabh. As a bowler, you obviously want to take the DRS whevever possible. We've got 2 reviews, so obviously one is for me (laughs off).</p>",

A great game for the neutral fan, makes the IPL table a bit more competitive. Let\u2019s see tomorrow if Punjab can pull up any trees and drag down Rajasthan from their perch.
