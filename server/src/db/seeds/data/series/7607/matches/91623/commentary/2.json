I feel it was the need of the hour for me. I went out to bat, needed someone to bat till the end. I just enjoyed my time. It's from the Mumbai school of arts, have played a lot of cricket at Wankhede. When the ball stopped seaming, I played all my shots that I practice in the nets. I feel the intent would have been the same, I would have definitely played in the same pattern.</p>",

    "commText": "<p>A SKY special lit up the night at the Wankhede. The five-time IPL champions got off the bottom place as a result of that special knock. SRH looked solid at the start of the tournament when their batters were in prime form and going all guns blazing, however, since the time SRH have rested/ dropped Markram, they haven't been able to post such daunting totals. Not sure why they have tinkered with a match-winning combination when it wasn't required. That has only given a chance to other teams in the tournament to climb up the ladder and make sure that the points table becomes interesting. For now, it's goodbye from <b>Nikhil, Sagar, Anurag</b> and <b>Praveen.</b> Good night folks!</p>",
