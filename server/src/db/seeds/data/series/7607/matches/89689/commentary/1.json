Chepauk isn't known to be the truest batting surface in the country and that tells you how well CSK have done today. They were asked to bat first and got off to a flier thanks to Rachin Ravindra. His timing was sublime right from the outset and the runs flowed freely. Ruturaj got an early reprieve as he was dropped at slip in the very first over. Both openers eventually fell for 46 and it looked like GT had pulled things back slightly after the powerplay. Rahane struggled to get going and he was out stumped trying to up the ante. CSK needed to get the momentum back in their favor and Shivam Dube helped them do exactly that. He struck them cleanly right from ball one and he raced along to a 23-ball 51. Mitchell played second-fiddle and a nice little cameo from Rizvi helped take CSK over 200. This might not be a typical Chennai wicket but this total will take some chasing. Back shortly.</p>",
