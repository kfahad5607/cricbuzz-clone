The way Delhi started after being put into bat, it never looked like they'd get 200 let alone 220. Sandeep Warrier nipped out three in the powerplay and Axar, who was promoted to number 3, and Rishabh Pant were left to rebuild. They took their time to get their eye in and played out a few overs with caution. With GT's spinners coming on, they slowly started expanding their range of shots before Axar decided to floor the pedal around the 10th over. Axar was eventually dismissed for 66 - his highest IPL score but DC's scoring rate only kept going with Pant and Stubbs at the crease. It looked like DC would target around 180 but a gamble from GT to bowl Sai Kishore in the 19th over only helped the Capitals. That over went for 22 and the final over was the cherry on top as Pant picked off 31 runs off it. Massive chase coming up for GT.</p>",

My role was to take on the three spinners, the talk was that we should take the partnership as deep as possible, the ball wasn't coming onto the bat, was a slow pitch. The mindset is very important, you can't think about playing off a bowler, the mindset was to be attacking, take the single and twos on offer and keep rotating the strike. We thought 170-180 would be a good score, so this (224 should be enough to win the match)</p>",
