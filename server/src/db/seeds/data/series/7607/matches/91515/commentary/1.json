Sandeep Warrier nipped out three in the powerplay and Axar, who was promoted to number 3, and Rishabh Pant were left to rebuild. They took their time to get their eye in and played out a few overs with caution. With GT's spinners coming on, they slowly started expanding their range of shots before Axar decided to floor the pedal around the 10th over. Axar was eventually dismissed for 66 - his highest IPL score but DC's scoring rate only kept going with Pant and Stubbs at the crease. It looked like DC would target around 180 but a gamble from GT to bowl Sai Kishore in the 19th over only helped the Capitals. That over went for 22 and the final over was the cherry on top as Pant picked off 31 runs off it. Massive chase coming up for GT.</p>",
