The pitch was on the better side in the first innings. Second innings there was extra seam movement and spongy bounce. I felt he (Rachin) was missing it by a big margin. We couldn't get going in the first three overs and that was the difference. At the halfway stage it was getable. There was extra seam movement and we couldn't capitalize and we were always behind. We didn't get the big over to reduce the run rate. Not really (if an extra bowler in the line up with help in powerplay). Deepak is always used to bowling 3 overs. Even though the first four overs were good, the last two overs were expensive. After two good games you can expect the third game to go below par and that's nothing to worry about. Just two or three hits here and there, in the field if we had stopped one or two boundaries it could have been different.</p>",
