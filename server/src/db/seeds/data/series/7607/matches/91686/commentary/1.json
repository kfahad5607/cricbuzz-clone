If the batter doesn\u2019t pick it, then it increases your chance of getting a wicket. I\u2019ve been bowling it for almost five years now. In the last year and a half, I wasn\u2019t able to execute it consistently so I didn't try it in the first half of the IPL. It gives me so many options at the death, the batters are ready for that slower one and I can sneak in a yorker or a quick length ball. And when you get the batters out, they can\u2019t get that acceleration at the death. They are probably 10-15 below par, I think we bowled really well after the powerplay. Hopefully we can play some sensible cricket and chase this down.</p>",
