We doubt many could achieve the strike rates that Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head are recording even while playing book cricket or hand cricket. Never before have so many runs ever been scored in the first 10 overs of an IPL game. Never before has anyone at Cricbuzz been able to switch off their laptops before 11pm during an IPL game. Grateful for that early finish, this is Saurabh Shankar signing off on behalf of Pradeep, Kumar, Akshay and Siva.</p>",

Just concentrate on getting in good positions, watch the ball hard and try to maximise the powerplay. (On his spin hitting) It is something I have been working on, it will be a big part in the Caribbean as well. It is important to go 360 in the modern game. (On fearless cricket) The last 12 months, that's how they wanted me to play in the Aussie team, and that's what I've been told to do here as well. Nothing much that I have to change. (On Abhishek Sharma) I know how hard he works and how deep he thinks, his spin play is second to none. We compliment each other very well. Nice to see him back amongst the runs after missing out the last couple of game. (On NRR) We didn't think about it till the Timeout, but after that the boys came out and told us to score quickly. The crowd was exceptional tonight, that's what we needed after losing the last two. I haven't got many things over him, so that's good to know that I have more runs than David Warner did in his first SRH season. We start again whenever we come out here for the next game.</p>",

(On Travis Head) He's been like this for 2 years, he hits the tough areas, hits the middle a lot, might not be super conventional. (On Abhishek Sharma) Just an incredible player of spin and pace. With just 2 fielders out, it is really difficult for the bowlers against them. (On where the game is headed) I think the scores have gone up, and when the wickets are good, it is tough to come up with answers against batters when they get going. The boys have had a fantastic season, but to win this with less than 10 overs played is unreal.</p>",

The modern T20 cricketer believes in carnage, believes in clearing that front leg and whacking it to all parts of the ground. It is no longer about winning games, it is about obliterating oppositions with net run rates facing fatal consequences. Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma made batting look easier than EA Cricket on amateur mode, as they devoured into the LSG bowlers, inflicting a brutal loss to the visitors. The first over went for just 8 runs, and that was the only joy LSG got the whole innings. Abhishek Sharma dispatched Thakur for four consecutive boundaries, and then Travis Head latched onto Gowtham, plundering 22 runs off it. The Aussie batter scored a 16-ball fifty, as SRH finished the powerplay with 107 runs. Abhishek Sharma wasn't too far behind, as he got a 19-ball fifty. The hitting never stopped even after the fifties, as both batters went hell for leather to help SRH chase down the target in less than 10 overs. Stick around for the presentations...</p>",
