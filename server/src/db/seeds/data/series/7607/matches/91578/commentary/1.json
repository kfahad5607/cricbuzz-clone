The powerplay was a good one for CSK as they did not lose a wicket and the platform was set. But as soon as the spinners came, the brakes were applied. Rahul Chahar and Harpreet Brar bossed the middle overs and did not concede a boundary. The left-arm spinner got Rahane and Dube in the same over. Chahar got Jadeja who was promoted to 4. CSK brought in their impact sub - Rizvi who played a laboured innings before he was out. At the other end seeing all this was Gaikwad who nudged around and then went on to complete his fifty. The end overs acceleration too did not come and PBKS restrict CSK to 162. The pitch has bounce and turn for the spinners and CSK have Jadeja and Mo. Even game at this moment, back for the chase in 5 minutes...</p>",
