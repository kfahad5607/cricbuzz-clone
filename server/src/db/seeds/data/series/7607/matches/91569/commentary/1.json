The two left-handers - Ishan Kishan and Nehal Wadhera - steadided the ship somewhat by stitching a half-century stand (slowest of IPL 2024). Kishan was dropped on 8 by Turner off Mayank's bowling but the MI opener eventually perished against Bishnoi for 32 at a SR under 90. Nehal Wadhera upped the ante and MI's scoring rate crossed 6 RPO in the 16th over. Mohsin Khan bowled a superb yorker to clean up the set batter. Tim David's little cameo towards the end ensured Mumbai crossed 140. Lucknow will be pleased with their bowling performance.
