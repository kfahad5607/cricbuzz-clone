My mind and my body is getting used to the rigour, I hope to do better in the upcoming games. It's tough to come back from a back injury, but I'm feeling comfortable. I haven't made any adjustments (to the bowling action), but I hadn't practiced anything for the last three months, so it takes time to get back to using your fingers for spinning the ball. The most important thing is to get back to consistency. There hasn't been a difference between then and now (before his injury), it's all about mind games, I don't worry too much about it. He's been amazing (on Shubman Gill), has kept the team in a relatively cool and calm space, the amount of confidence he inspires is great. Ashu Bhai and the rest of the coaches are always there to encourage us, they know a lot about the game and the opposition, that's the discussion between myself and Ashish (Nehra)</p>",

After the batting fest in Hyderabad where 523 runs were scored, coming close on the heels of a 412-run contest in Kolkata, SRH might have to quickly readjust the tempo depending on what type of pitch is offered in Ahmedabad. But who better than their captain Pat Cummins, coach Daniel Vettori, and the Indian crowd silencer Travis Head to adapt to the venue that brought the trio a big golden prize last November. \\n \\nFor the Titans, they'll be hoping that the comfort of home aids them in getting back on track as they return from the trip to Chennai where they were humbled by the defending champions by a 63-run margin. With the batting order still finding its feet under new captain Shubman Gill and the bowling unit trying to mask the absence of a big name like Mohammed Shami, the Titans might just prefer a slow surface which the venue tends to provide every now and again. \\n \\n<b>When:</b> Sunday, March 31 at 15:30 IST \\n \\n<b>Where:</b> Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad \\n \\n<b>What to expect:</b> Sometimes, the pitches here are slow. Sometimes, they are belters. There were a few high-scoring games in IPL 2023 but there have been some middling totals here too. The 2023 World Cup matches played here were proof of that. In the previous season, the Titans failed to defend 204 against the Knight Riders and then kept Lucknow Super Giants to 171 after posting a massive 227 in the afternoon matches at this venue. \\n \\n<b>Head to head:</b> Titans 2-1 Sunrisers \\n \\n<b>Team watch</b> \\n \\n<b>Gujarat Titans</b> \\n \\n<b>Injury/Availability:</b> Matthew Wade has joined the team ahead of their third match and should be available for selection, having missed the first couple of games to take part in the Sheffield Shield final. \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> Mohit Sharma picked up 4 for 28 the last time GT played against SRH at this venue. With 17 wickets in overs 16-20 and an economy of 8.69, he will be their key bowler in the death, going up against SRH's powerful batting lineup. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill (c), Sai Sudharsan, Vijay Shankar, David Miller, Azmatullah Omarzai, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, R Sai Kishore, Umesh Yadav, Spencer Johnson. [Impact sub: Mohit Sharma for Sai Sudharsan]. \\n \\n<b>Sunrisers Hyderabad</b> \\n \\n<b>Injury/Availability:</b> There is still no clarity on when Wanindu Hasaranga will join the SRH team. T Natarajan missed the last game due to a niggle and if fit, he could replace Jaydev Unadkat although the latter did exceedingly well against Mumbai's band of heavy hitters. \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> Both Abhishek Sharma and Heinrich Klaasen have a favourable matchup against premier legspinner Rashid Khan. Both have been dismissed only once each by the Afghanistan wrist spinner and have a strike rate of 204.35 and 196.77 respectively against him, with five fours and eight sixes between them. Meanwhile, SRH will look to use Bhuvneshwar Kumar's good numbers against Shubman Gill to their advantage, with the experienced seamer having dismissed the GT captain three times and conceding only 50 off 48. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Travis Head, Mayank Agarwal, Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Markande, T Natarajan/Jaydev Unadkat. [Impact sub: Umran Malik for Travis Head]. \\n \\n<b>Did you know?</b> \\n \\n- Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Umran Malik both bagged five-wicket hauls in two different games against Titans and both were in losing causes. \\n \\n- None of the Titans batters have registered a fifty-plus score so far in IPL 2024, with Sai Sudharsan's 45 off 39 against MI being their highest. \\n \\n- Mohammed Shami has picked up 28 wickets in the powerplay alone, at an average of 21.25, with a strike rate of 18 and economy of 7.08. The rest of the GT bowlers combined have 27 wickets at an average of 41.44 and strike rate of 28, with an economy of 8.88 in this phase. \\n \\n<b>What they said?</b> \\n \\n\"I've been really impressed with the way he's conducted himself as a leader. I think he's embraced it (captaincy) really well. He's shown some good leadership qualities. He's a smart guy. He's a young captain, and there's lots to learn, especially in T20. So, he'll learn along the way.\" - <b>Gary Kirsten</b>, GT mentor.</p>",
