    "commText": "<p><b>Preview</b> by <b>Prakash Govindasreenivasan </b> \\n \\nMS Dhoni's words after CSK made it to their 10th final last season through the first qualifier against Gujarat Titans summed up the team's ability to weaponize their home conditions. CSK are only one of the few teams capable of doing that, and yet that has been a bit of a lottery. CSK lost three home games in 2023, including one on a true surface on which they scored 200 batting first. The slowness in the surface that has often helped Dhoni box the opposition in with spin has appeared and vanished on a whim. \\n \\nThe nature of the surface this early in the season might not concern Gujarat Titans though. They come with a heady dose of adrenaline coursing through them from downing Mumbai Indians in an extremely close home fixture just one night ago after what transpired between the two in the off-season. The heist - with some tight middle-overs and death bowling, reestablished the fact that Titans continue to be the sum of their parts. \\n \\nShould Chepauk revert to type on Tuesday, Mohit Sharma's variations will be handy. Mohit has featured in 14 previous IPL fixtures at the venue, picking 18 wickets, with an economy rate of 7.25. Left-arm spinner R Sai Kishore, who got a wet ball to grip and dip in dewy conditions in Ahmedabad - will also be relied upon by GT as they take him back to his domestic home turf. Against MI, GT demonstrated their ability to not get thrown off course by the pressures of a six or two in a tight defence of their total. CSK with their ability to field at least 10 players capable of successfully swinging for the fences will be a sterner test of their resolve. \\n \\n<b>When:</b> Chennai Super Kings vs Gujarat Titans, IPL 2024, March 26, 19:30 IST \\n \\n<b>Where:</b> M.A. Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai \\n \\n<b>What to expect:</b> The unexpected. The conditions for the season opener weren't typical. It's the sort of unpredictability that the home team had to grapple with last season too. Fleming reckoned the pitches at this time of the season will be 'well-prepared' and get slow only with wear and tear as the campaign goes on. \\n \\n<b>Head to head:</b> Chennai Super Kings 2 - 3 Gujarat Titans \\n \\n<b>Team Watch:</b> \\n \\n<b>Chennai Super Kings</b> \\n \\n<b>Injury/Availability:</b> Matheesha Pathirana has joined the CSK squad and Fleming confirmed that he is available for selection. It'll be very un-CSK like however, to relegate Mustafizur Rahman to the bench after the kind of outing he had against RCB in the season opener. \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> Shivam Dube has only 71 runs in 5 innings against GT at a strike rate of 116.39 but could still hold the aces through the middle. GT operate with two spinners whose stock delivery will turn into the left-hander (Rashid Khan and R Sai Kishore) - the kind of bowler (left-arm spinner Mayank Dagar) that RCB kept away from Dube last Friday. Expect a lot of googlies from Rashid, who is yet to dismiss Dube in 15 deliveries in the IPL. \\n \\nDealing with Rashid and Sai Kishore will also be a good test for CSK's right-handed tyro Sameer Rizvi who comes with the reputation of being a spin hitter. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Rachin Ravindra, Ruturaj Gaikwad (c), Ajinkya Rahane, Daryl Mitchell, Sameer Rizvi, Ravindra Jadeja, MS Dhoni, Deepak Chahar, Tushar Deshpande, Maheesh Theekshana, Mustafizur Rahman [Impact Sub: Shivam Dube for Mustafizur Rahman] \\n \\n<b>Gujarat Titans</b> \\n \\n<b>Injury/Availability:</b> Matthew Wade should remain out of contention having featured in the Sheffield Shield final that concluded on March 24. \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> Ruturaj Gaikwad has four 50-plus scores in five innings against GT at a strike rate of 146.85 but has struggled against left-arm pacers in the PowerPlay in the IPL [strike rate of 112.3 and 10 dismissals]. Enter, Spencer Johnson. \\n \\nLetting Ruturaj get to the middle-overs unscathed will not be ideal for GT as the CSK captain has the knack of taking down Rashid Khan - 95 runs scored in 60 balls at a strike rate of 158.33. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Shubman Gill (c), Wriddhiman Saha, Sai Sudharsan, Azmatullah Omarzai, Vijay Shankar, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, R Sai Kishore, Umesh Yadav, Spencer Johnson [Impact Sub: Mohit Sharma for Sai Sudharsan] \\n \\n<b>Did You Know?</b> \\n \\n- Ravindra Jadeja has picked 30 wickets in 43 IPL games at Chepauk, operating with an economy rate of 6.85 \\n \\n- David Miller has enjoyed playing against CSK - he has 368 runs in 14 innings at a strike rate of 140.45 \\n \\n- Since 2023, Daryl Mitchell has scored 1124 runs in T20s at a strike rate of 142.82 \\n \\n- Since 2023, Azmatullah Omarzai has been gun PowerPlay bowler in T20s - 18 wickets at an average of 16.83, strike rate of 14.67 and an economy rate of 6.88 \\n \\n<b>What They Said:</b> \\n \\n\"It's still very early in the competition, there's still combinations being worked out, still cohesion within the team that you're working on, so it is nice to win the early game. But there's a lot going on in regards to settling in and getting into the competition.\" -<b> Stephen Fleming</b> \\n \\n \\n\"The way the boys held their nerves with dew coming in, it was outstanding. The way our spinners bowled made sure we are always in the game. It's all about holding your nerves.\" - <b>Shubman Gill</b></p>",
