    "commText": "<p><b>Preview by Vijay Tagore:</b> \\n \\n A telling piece of statistic that aptly captures Hardik Pandya's widely debated captaincy is the frequency of him opening the bowling. In 92 IPL games prior to assuming the leadership role, he opened the attack just six times. Since taking over the reins in 2022, he has opened the bowling on 17 occasions out of 33 matches, including in the first two games of IPL 2024. \\n \\nThis oddity is underscored by a recent decision of calling upon Jasprit Bumrah for his second over in 13th of Sunrisers Hyderabad's innings. It was in this game that Mumbai Indians conceded the highest IPL total of 277 for 3. It would seem that the team's bowling strategy is going haystack despite IPL veteran like Lasith Malinga among the support staff. For the record, MI have the worst economy rate among the 10 teams since the start of IPL 2023. \\n \\n\"Yeah, that day the things were a little different. But at that particular time, what your captain, what the team feels is the best for the team, he was doing that. Most of the times we have seen Jasprit pulling one odd over in the power play and then one in the middle and a couple of overs in the death. Most of the bowlers, not only from our team, even from the other team, all went for runs. So the game was like that. The surface was like that,\" Piyush Chawla, the MI spinner, said defending the bowling changes. \\n \\nAmidst the questionable bowling changes, certain batting calls have also raised eyebrows. For instance, the choice to shield Tim David by Tilak Varma from facing Rashid Khan in the first match seemed unconventional, much like Pandya's decision to bat at No. 7 in the same game, ostensibly to evade facing Rashid Khan, a notion suggested by Irfan Pathan, Pandya's Baroda mate. \\n \\nNo wonder then that Mumbai are without a win from two games but then MI losing initial games is nothing new. They have been here and done that. They have the wherewithal to bounce back, more so when they are playing four games on the bounce at home. But they certainly need to review their strategies - bowling in particular -- when they take on Rajasthan Royals at the Wankhede on Monday night. \\n \\nThe visitors have had a blazing start to the season with all wings of the side working. The captaincy of Sanju Samson has been very sagacious while the team's investment on Riyan Parag is paying off. The R Ashwin-Yuzvendra Chahal combination has started well while Avesh Khan and Sandeep Sharma, the two Indian pacers, have done well too. Trent Boult, well, has been Trent Boult. \\n \\nThe only concern for the Royals may be the form of Jos Buttler who, interestingly, got five ducks last year, the most for anyone in a single edition, and managed only scores of 11(9) and 11(16) in this season so far. Given his quality and experience, the team management will persist with the English captain for now but at some stage during the season, they could unleash Tom Kohler-Cadmore. \\n \\n<b>When:</b> Mumbai Indians vs Rajasthan Royals, IPL 2024, March 29, 19:30 IST \\n \\n<b>Where:</b> Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai \\n \\n<b>What to expect:</b> Five of the seven matches at the Wankhede last year were won by the chasing side, effectively forcing the captain winning the toss to bowl first. It should be a high-scoring game and the venue has seen some big run-chases. It can't be any different on Monday night. \\n \\n<b>Head to Head:</b> MI 15 - 12 RR. At the Wankhede, MI have a 5-3 edge. Last year RR came close to beating MI at the venue but they failed to defend 212/7, with Tim David showcasing his finishing prowess. \\n \\n<b>Team Watch</b> \\n \\n<b>Mumbai Indians</b> \\n \\n<b>Injury and availability:</b> Barring Suryakumar Yadav, who is undergoing rehab at the NCA, all other players are available. \\n \\n<b>Tactics and Match-ups:</b> MI will want to use Jasprit Bumrah in the PowerPlay for early breakthroughs and it is unlikely there will be too many changes to the XI. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Ishan Kishan (wk), Rohit Sharma, Naman Dhir, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya (c), Tim David, Gerald Coetzee, Shams Mulani, Piyush Chawla, Jasprit Bumrah, Kwena Maphaka \\n \\n<b>Rajasthan Royals</b> \\n \\n<b>Injury and availability:</b> There is no reported injury and all players available. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Yashasvi Jaiswal, Jos Buttler, Sanju Samson (c & wk), Riyan Parag, Shimron Hetmyer, Dhruv Jurel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Trent Boult, Yuzvendra Chahal, Sandeep Sharma, Avesh Khan. \\n \\n<b>Tactics and match-ups:</b> It's unlikely the Royals will tamper with their winning formula. They would be expected to attack Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan through Trent Boult, who is known to provide early breakthroughs. \\n \\n<b>Did you know?</b> \\n \\n- Of all the venues that hosted at least five matches in IPL 2023, Wankhede had the joint-highest average first-innings score (198), alongside Mohali. \\n \\n- After bagging the Orange Cap in RR's runners-up finish in 2022, Buttler recorded five ducks last year, the most for anyone in a single edition, and has registered scores of 11(9) and 11(16) in his two IPL 2024 outings so far. \\n \\n- Hardik's tenure as MI's captain has started with back-to-back defeats, and he now returns to Wankhede where he has played 35 out of his 125 IPL matches. \\n \\n<b>What they said:</b> \\n \\n\"Everyone is different, Rohit has a different way of leading the side, Hardik has a different way. As we all know, Hardik is one of the successful captains coming from GT where they made two finals in two years.\" <b>- Piyush Chawla</b> \\n \\n\"I think this tournament and T20 cricket is all about momentum. You always want to win every game, but it is about playing good cricket and getting on a roll. We've had a good start to the season equally. Last year we had a good start to the tournament and things didn't quite go the way we wanted.\" <b>- Trent Boult</b></p>",
