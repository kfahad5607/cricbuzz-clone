Suddenly he flicked a switch and hit consecutive sixes off Chawla to get going. But the innings that really sparked LSG's score was Pooran's. He showed why he is so destructive in this format as he clouted sixes at will - 8 in total. He struck them cleanly and his knock suddenly catapulted LSG and set them on their way to 230-240 but his dismissal sparked a mini collapse before Ayush Badoni and Krunal Pandya added cameos to take LSG to 214. Pandya may have missed a trick at not bowling more spin when Pooran was there as the quick bowlers were taken apart. Can MI end with a win? Back for the reply in 5 minutes...</p>",
