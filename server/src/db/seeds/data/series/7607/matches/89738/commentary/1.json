LSG lost a bit of momentum after the powerplay but RCB handed it back by bowling Dagar and Green for 4 consecutive overs. de Kock and Stoinis made the most of that move and a smashed 50+ partnership in quick time. Maxwell broke that stand and it seemed RCB were pulling things back, but Pooran was dropped in the 17th over by Rawat and he made them pay by smashing 5 sixes in the last two overs to take LSG past the 180-mark.
