    "commText": "<p><b>Preview</b> by <b>Kaushik Rangarajan</b> \\n \\nThere was barely a flicker of expectation for Royal Challengers Bengaluru when they returned home after a beatdown in Mumbai; the fifth loss in six games to start the season was pronounced as the end of their campaign. Director of Cricket Mo Bobat was also asked if the remainder of the tournament was a unique free pass to build for 2025. He admitted to the team's failings but responded in the negative. \"There's a point when it's not in our hands, that's when you might think differently.\" Into the 14th match of their campaign, that point hasn't been reached and Mission Impossible has morphed slowly into Mission Entirely Probable. \\n \\nThe IPL has always loved such cinematic narratives. Even if the reality - the head-to-head records, matchups, forecast - make for prosaic reading, that it's CSK clustering together with RCB for the one remaining playoffs spot makes for persuasive packaging. Throw in Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, Dinesh Karthik and the notion of a 'last dance' for added gravitas on the penultimate day of a 70-game league phase. \\n \\nThe forecast notwithstanding, RCB's final home game of the season is no longer fraught with the hopelessness that surrounded the build-up to that SRH game a month ago. Then, they were happy to finish within 25 runs of a record total. Reasons to be fearful are fewer this time with both arms to their game syncing in harmony. That CSK's batting has lost some of the zing from last year and that their bowling has lost key personnel ought to bring an added dose of optimism for RCB. \\n \\nThe hosts also have form on their side: they're on a five-game winning run while CSK have not won more than two in a row at any point this season. Even the recent win against Rajasthan Royals wasn't as clinical as it could have been. There were catches dropped and an opportunity to boost the NRR wasn't chased. But the win will have helped flush a particularly chastening visit to Ahmedabad. What the visitors have in troves though is big-match pedigree: CSK are chasing a 13th visit to the final-four in 15 seasons. Experience in the ranks of having been there and done that is priceless, as is the advantage of knowing that a win, of any kind, or a washout is enough. Even a small loss will do. \\n \\n<b>Scenarios: An NRR game on RCB's hands </b> \\n \\nRCB have to win at least by a margin of 18 runs if they bat first i.e if they score 200, they'll have to restrict CSK to 182 or less. This bat-first scenario doesn't change even in a truncated five-over contest: if they make 75 in a five-over contest, they'll need to restrict the opposition to 57 or less, failing which CSK will go through. \\n \\nIf RCB are batting second and CSK post 200, the hosts will have to get to 201 with 11 or more balls to spare. If they hit a six from 200, they can complete the chase with up to 8 balls to spare. The chasing equation gets complicated in a truncated game. A target of 75 in a five-over clash, for example, will have to be chased down in 3.1 overs for their NRR to go above CSK's. \\n \\n<b>When: </b>Royal Challengers Bengaluru vs Chennai Super Kings, IPL 2024, May 18, 19:30 IST \\n \\n<b>Where: </b>M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru \\n \\n<b>What to expect: </b>A start-stop game. There is an 80% forecast for rain that is expected to hit Bengaluru CBD around match-start time. The sub-surface aeration at the stadium should facilitate a quick restart. The six games here have been split in the middle between wins for target setting and chasing teams. \\n \\n<b>Head to Head: </b>RCB 10 - 21 CSK. The Super Kings have won each of their last three as well as five of the last six contests against RCB. Only MI has more wins against a single opponent (23 vs KKR) than CSK's 21 wins against RCB. \\n \\n<b>Team Watch: </b> \\n \\n<b>Royal Challengers Bengaluru </b> \\n \\n<b>Injuries/Availability: </b>Will Jacks and Reece Topley have returned home to begin World Cup prep and will not be available for this game. Glenn Maxwell should return to the XI \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups: </b>Yash Dayal has been excellent in the PowerPlay in Bengaluru, hitting his lengths perfectly and also finding swing. He'll be a threat to both Rachin Ravindra and Ruturaj Gaikwad at the top of innings. They have been dismissed five times and thrice respectively by left-arm seamers this season. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI: </b>Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Glenn Maxwell, Cameron Green, Mahipal Lomror, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Swapnil Singh, Karn Sharma, Lockie Ferguson, Mohammed Siraj [Impact Sub: Vijaykumar Vyshak/Yash Dayal] \\n \\n<b>Chennai Super Kings</b> \\n \\n<b>Injuries/Availability: </b>Matheesha Pathirana and Deepak Chahar are unavailable due to hamstring injuries while Mustafizur Rahman and Moeen Ali have left for international commitments. \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups: </b>Ravindra Jadeja has excellent match-ups with three of RCB's key batters. He has dismissed Maxwell six times while also accounting for Kohli and Karthik three times each. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI: </b>Ruturaj Gaikwad (c), Rachin Ravindra, Daryl Mitchell, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, MS Dhoni (wk), Shardul Thakur, Tushar Deshpande, Mitchell Santner/Richard Gleeson, Simarjeet Singh, Maheesh Theekshana [Impact Sub: Sameer Rizvi] \\n \\n<b>Did you know? </b> \\n \\n- RCB became the fourth side to have sequences of five successive wins and defeats each in the same season. Deccan Chargers in 2010, PBKS in 2020 and SRH in 2022 are the other teams to have such mixed league runs. \\n \\n- Shivam Dube averages 113.50 against RCB. His four scores against them read: 46 (32), 95* (46), 52 (27) and 34* (28) \\n \\n- In a reversal of traditional strengths, RCB's spinners have taken more wickets this season (20 at 20.3 SR) than CSK's have (13 at 34.6 SR) \\n \\n<b>What they said: </b> \\n \\n\"We prepare well as a bowling group, we have very good plans. And tomorrow is no different, RCB will have to try to beat us off our plans. And if they do that, well played to them. But if they don't, then... next season for them.\" - <b>Dwayne Bravo</b> on coming up against an aggressive RCB batting line-up.</p>",

But they do need to win and then hope for a slip up from both RR and SRH if they're to entertain hopes of finishing in the top-2 and secure a place in the Qualifier 1 against the Knight Riders.

Three weeks can turn around your fortunes. We are trying to hunt down a side that has done really well in the tournament. We had nothing to lose a few games ago but now we know the value of pushing and recreating it again and again. There are a formidable and balanced side. The way they play their cricket, one of the most successful sides in this league. They come good in big games, it's a great challenge for us. The way we (RCB) have played in the last five games is pretty symbolic of what RCB is capable of. Playing some good cricket, big names, playing some high octane cricket, great to be a part of it. I will remember this journey for a long time. Every year there's going to be a team at the halfway stage almost where we were. I am wishing that we take one step forward.
