LSG went into the innings break having scored 199/8 in 20 overs. However, Shikhar Dhawan and Jonny Bairstow came out all guns blazing and dominated the powerplay. Both the openers attacked the bowlers from the outset and had a fantastic opening partnership of 102. Just when the run chase looked in Punjab's control, young pacer - Mayank Yadav came into the attack and bowled an inspiring spell. He hit the 150-kph mark regularly and rattled the Punjab batters with his raw pace and bounce. He broke the opening partnership by dismissing Bairstow initially, and later got two more wickets in the form of Prabhsimran Singh and Jitesh Sharma. Shikhar Dhawan who was watching wickets fall from the other end, lost momentum and even he succumbed under pressure. Punjab kept losing wickets at regular intervals for the rest of the chase and despite Livingstone's cameo, they fell short by 21 runs. Stay around for the presentations..</p>",

It was nice facing him, I was surprised at his pace, but I wanted to use his pace against him, but he bowled the bouncers and the yorkers well. I was quite mindful, asked the batters to use the short side and use his pace, but he bowled into his body (on Bairstow's dismissal) and got him OUT, I said the same to Jitesh as well. But Mohsin bowled really well, he kept a good length and suffocated us. We will have to analyse these defeats, the drop catch did cost us some momentum. That's something we'll have to improve going forward.</p>",

He got injured in the first warm up game last season and got ruled out so had to manage him better this time. He bowled 155 tonight and made life uncomfortable. He ran in and that was the pleasing thing for all of us.
