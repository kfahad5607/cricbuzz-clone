Both the openers attacked the bowlers from the outset and had a fantastic opening partnership of 102. Just when the run chase looked in Punjab's control, young pacer - Mayank Yadav came into the attack and bowled an inspiring spell. He hit the 150-kph mark regularly and rattled the Punjab batters with his raw pace and bounce. He broke the opening partnership by dismissing Bairstow initially, and later got two more wickets in the form of Prabhsimran Singh and Jitesh Sharma. Shikhar Dhawan who was watching wickets fall from the other end, lost momentum and even he succumbed under pressure. Punjab kept losing wickets at regular intervals for the rest of the chase and despite Livingstone's cameo, they fell short by 21 runs. Stay around for the presentations..</p>",

I was quite mindful, asked the batters to use the short side and use his pace, but he bowled into his body (on Bairstow's dismissal) and got him OUT, I said the same to Jitesh as well.
