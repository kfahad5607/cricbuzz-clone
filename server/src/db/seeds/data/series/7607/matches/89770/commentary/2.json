But LSG find ways to defend totals if their batters post totals in excess of 160. Mind you, GT got off to a brisk start as well with the bat. In Saha's absence Sai\u00a0Sudharsan opened\u00a0the innings with Gill and the stylish left-hander was\u00a0quick to get off the blocks. They forged the first 50-plus opening stand for the Titans this season with Sudharsan being the aggressor. Naveen-ul-Haq conceded a couple of fours off his first over, Mayank Yadav leaked three boundaries off his opening over. And, then Siddharth bowled three front-foot no-balls in an over after a couple of tight overs. It was Yash Thakur who provided the breakthrough for LSG as he castled the GT captain with a pacy full ball off the final ball of the powerplay. That opened the floodgates. KL Rahul turned to his experienced spinners and they delivered tonight. Bishnoi took a screamer off his own bowling to remove KW and Krunal Pandya varied his pace smartly to pick a three-fer. The Titans slipped from 54/0 to 80/5 and they couldn't recover from it. Thakur, who started it all, came back to finish with impressive figures of 5/30. He stepped up for his team after Mayank Yadav left the field with a side strain.</p>",

We got a decent start, but we lost wickets in the middle and couldn't recover from that. Our bowlers were exceptional as they restricted them to 160-odd, just that our batters let us down. (On missing David Miller) Miller is a kind of a player who can change a game in a couple of overs, because I think this total was very gettable for us. (On his dismissal) I thought it was the last over of the powerplay and I just wanted to make the most of it, just that I missed that ball as I tried to play a bit too square. It was tremendous to watch our bowlers bowl, we were looking forward to restricting them around 160-165.</p>",

It comes off some days and it doesn't some days. I back my strengths and stuck to my plans, one of those days I executed what I wanted, tonight it came off. It feels great to defend this score, the way we have defended even last year. [on Mayank Yadav] I don't know what is happening, but I had a couple of seconds with him, he seems OK. He is a bright prospect, bowled gun in the nets, last year missed out. Good head on his shoulders and unbelievable prospect and interesting to see how he will pan out in his career.</p>",

Having the home advantage helps. The bowlers have come through the ranks over the last couple of years. you have seen the same guys bowling in the last season as well., They have adjusted to their roles. Hopefully we can continue this. We knew that it wasn't as good as the wicket we played on (in the previous match here), also losing two wickets in the powerplay will set us back a bit. Unless someone carries on to get 70-80, it was tough to achieve\u00a0that 170-180. We just wanted to bat and see how much we can get. That's the advantage you have when you are batting first. All three spinners have been key for us. Sid coming in this season has done really well, he plays\u00a0a crucial part with the new ball, he's shown great temperament. His job is to restrict the batters. KP (Krunal Pandya) is very experienced, he's played IPL for so many seasons. Bishnoi has been around for so many years and keeps getting better.
