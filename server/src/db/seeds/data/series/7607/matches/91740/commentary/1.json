Yes, the surface was difficult and not a belter but surely it was not a 113 kind of pitch. There was swing, bounce and grip - KKR made the most of that by bowling in the right areas and never allowing SRH to get going. Starc once again struck in the first over and this time it was Abhishek who could got an absolute peach. Head managed to avoid Starc but succumbed to Vaibhav in the very next over. SRH's top order woes in the last few games came to the fore again as Tripathi too departed inside the powerplay. KKR didn't relent as they kept picking wickets at regular intervals, Markram and Klaasen got starts but could not convert them. Cummins played a cameo towards the end and got the total past 100. This is looking more like KKR's final to lose at the moment unless SRH come up with a magical bowling performance. Back soon with the chase..</p>",
