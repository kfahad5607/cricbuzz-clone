At the end of the day, we stand firm, back ourselves and back the talent we have. My body is feeling very good, I want to stay this way for another couple of years. We are not going to take it (target) lightly. These guys (SRH) are going to come out and try to defend this total. We have to make sure that we get a good powerplay. If we get 40-50 without loss or even one wicket down, we are on our way. The bowlers set it up very well. We as batters have to get the job done.</p>",

There was swing, bounce and grip - KKR made the most of that by bowling in the right areas and never allowing SRH to get going. Starc once again struck in the first over and this time it was Abhishek who could got an absolute peach. Head managed to avoid Starc but succumbed to Vaibhav in the very next over. SRH's top order woes in the last few games came to the fore again as Tripathi too departed inside the powerplay. KKR didn't relent as they kept picking wickets at regular intervals, Markram and Klaasen got starts but could not convert them. Cummins played a cameo towards the end and got the total past 100. This is looking more like KKR's final to lose at the moment unless SRH come up with a magical bowling performance. Back soon with the chase..</p>",

Peach, an absolute peach and Abhishek has no answers - this is some start from Starc once again, big game player and he's come to the fore once again.

Don't think Abhishek could've done anything about it, he just puts his head down and walks away. <b>Abhishek Sharma b Starc 2(5)</b></p>",
