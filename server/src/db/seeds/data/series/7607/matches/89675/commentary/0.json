Rohit has won five titles with MI but his removal from captaincy wasn't taken that well by a majority of the MI fans. So, Hardik against his former team finds himself in a soup.

No Hardik and Shami, those are two massive holes to fill. It'll also be interesting to see which four overseas players make it to the XI. Rashid Khan and David Miller are highly likely to make it. One frontline bowler should also feature - Spencer Johnson or Noor Ahmad or Joshua Little. The other spot will be the toughest decision for the team management. Will they play the experienced Kane Williamson who offers a lot of stability to the batting or will they be tempted to pick Azmatullah Omarzai,\u00a0the talented all-rounder?</p>",
