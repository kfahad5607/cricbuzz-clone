He was the much maligned bowler after Rinku Singh hit him for five consecutive sixes to win an improbable game. Ever since he has been down, but tonight it's his redemption story. His life has come full circle and he must be the happiest man on the planet right now. Sports gives us these moments. When you have a chance to turn things around. And what a turnaround this has been for Yash Dayal, imagine the pressure he must have been under - after that out of the roof six against MSD first ball. And suddenly all those old demons would have come back to speak to him in his head. Under extreme pressure against arguably the greatest finisher the game has ever seen, with zero room to hide anywhere, he gets him out and takes his side to the playoffs. So celebrate Yash Dayal tonight, RCB fans. Coming back to the last ball, another back of the hand slower ball dug in outside off, Jadeja swipes and misses. And the celebrations begin, the reactions of Kohli who nearly had his eye sockets pop out as he punches the air, Faf hugging Kohli, Anushka Sharma double fist-pumping and the crowd raising the decibel levels to such a notch that it could be heard from Kathriguppe to Cubbon Park. A game that certainly lived up to its billing and the packed Chinnaswamy will talk about this game for ages to come</p>",

They set the tone with the bat as everyone batted well to give their side 218 and then Maxwell struck first ball to remove Gaikwad to give them a dream start. The plans to Dube was spot-on and the dangerous left-hander was nipped out for a low score. The partnership between Rahane and Ravindra set the innings back on track but Lockie struck first ball to remove the former. Ravindra was run-out after a mix-up with Dube and one can now say that was the turning point of the game. Jadeja though did not give up and once again looked set to break RCB hearts as he struck them cleanly. And that man MSD threatened as well, that six over the roof at fine-leg would have brought back all the horror memories for RCB fans when CSK would win from nowhere. But credit to Yash Dayal who showed a cool head and forced a top-edge that got MS and from then he kept nailing the back of the hand slower balls and eventually took his side home. The crowd's reaction when RCB won must have been the loudest it has ever been as they milked it all in. So <b>6 on the trot for RCB and they make the playoffs</b>. Meanwhile a rare setback for CSK as they fail to make it to the last four. Stay tuned for the presentations...</p>",

There's a bit of spin as well and we needed to keep the batters guessing. In the end, we got the job done. If I could rewind time (on asking why he didn't bowl a yorker in the 19th over), but the wicket was doing a bit when bowled on a length.

We kept losing wickets at regular intervals, it was a matter of one or two hits, sometimes that can happen in a T20 game. Pretty happy with what the target was, to sum up the season, I am pretty happy to have seven wins out of 14 games. Just couldn't get over the line in the last two balls. With the kind of injuries we had, missing out on two frontline bowlers, not having Conway at the top of the order as well, I think missing out on three key players made a huge difference. Credit to the CSK staff and everyone who put up a great show for us throughout the season. There were many challenges for us right throughout the first game. Injury to Fizz (Mustafizur), then injury to Pathirana as well, he came back and then again Pathirana missed out. When you have injuries around, you have to get that balance in the team and pick it (the team) for every game. I think this season sums up well where we had to tinker around with our playing XI, considering the injuries and all the illness (of the players) as well. Happy with the seven wins, couldn't get over the line though. Happy with it. We got 10 from the last 2 balls in our last knockout game last year so this was a similar situation, things didn't go our way (this season) though. For me, personal milestones don't really matter a lot, after all the ultimate goal is to win. If you are not getting there it's a disappointment. Doesn't matter if you score 100 runs or 500-600 runs in a season. I am disappointed (after losing.)</p>",

Unbelievable and such a great atmosphere, such a pleasure\u00a0to finish\u00a0off the season at home with a win. Batting first, I think it was the hardest pitch\u00a0I have ever played on in T20s. Myself and Virat were talking about 140-150 after we came back from the rain break. The communication from the umpires\u00a0was there was a lot of rain on the pitch, they wanted to push the game and that makes sense. When we came back, my goodness, I was telling Mitch Santner it was like a day 5 Test match at Ranchi and to get 200 on that was unbelievable. The last 6 games the batters have batted with good intent and good strike-rate. We were slow earlier on and we wanted more intent and that was awesome. We were defending 175, it got a bit close, at one stage, with MS there, I thought, oh dear, he has done it so many times. The way we bowled with the wet ball was unbelievable, we tried to change it. I dedicate this Man of the Match to Yash Dayal. The way he bowled\u00a0was unbelievable. For a man who's fairly new, he deserves it. [on what he told Dayal before the last over] Pace off is the best option on this pitch and trust your skills and enjoy, this is what you trained for. The yorker did not work the 1st ball and he went back to pace off and it worked unbelievably well. [on the crowd tonight] It's crazy, even when we weren't winning the fans were here. We in the changeroom we felt it was something we had to get right. Coming here tonight, it was set up nicely, CSK v RCB, unbelievable\u00a0atmosphere and we as a team will do a lap of honour to thank the\u00a0crowd for the support. It's really important that we enjoy this, great 6 games in a row and the first goal in the IPL is to get into the knockouts and we have done that, enjoy this but get back to work tomorrow.</p>",
