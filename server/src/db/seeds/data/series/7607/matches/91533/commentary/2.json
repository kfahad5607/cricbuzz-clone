It is not over when Mumbai's most powerful batter - Tim David - falls in the 18th over. It is only over when the last ball is bowled. That is the confidence and self belief of every batter in this edition. Tilak Varma was the standout for Mumbai, he played the anchor as well as the aggressor and with little more support, he would have taken the game away from Delhi. Rasikh Dar was the pick for the home side, he came on as an impact sub and picked up 3 for 34 in this high-scoring affair while the rest went for plenty. In the end it was his spell of four overs which made the difference. Stick around for the presentations..</p>",
