This first essay was all about Virat Kohli. He didn't have a great record at the venue or against RR and then there was the match-up with Boult, but Kohli has just gone about his business like only he can. He started slowly but paced his innings perfectly and reached his hundred in the 19th over. Faf played the perfect second fiddle in the 100+ opening stand and the platform was set, but the only disappointing thing was the likes of Maxwell and Green could not capitalize. That might be something which hurts RCB later on. For now we await RR's reply. Back soon..</p>",
