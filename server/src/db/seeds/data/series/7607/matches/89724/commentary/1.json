The Capitals openers started tepidly, negating the early swing and going at a run a ball for the first four overs. However, Warner flipped the switch in the third Deepak Chahar over as he took him down for two fours and a six. Shaw followed that up next over with four consecutive boundaries against Mustafizur. However, Chennai wrestled back the momentum with a couple of quiet overs post the powerplay, and that forced Warner to try a reverse ramp against Mustafizur. That proved to be his undoing as the southpaw perished shortly after his fifty thanks to a worldie catch from Pathirana. Shaw was out next over, with MS taking a sharp catch behind the wickets. Things stumbled in the middle overs for DC, as Pathirana bowled two superb yorkers to knock over Marsh and Stubbs. It looked like DC would amble to a sub par total post those two jolts, but skipper Rishabh Pant found some of his old form back as he plundered 17 runs off Pathirana's last over, notching up his first fifty since his comeback. 43 runs off the final three overs have helped the Capitals end on a good score, but will it be enough? Back shortly for the chase.</p>",
