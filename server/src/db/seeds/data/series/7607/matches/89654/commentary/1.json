No enough to clear the ropes, and Rahane from deep mid-wicket moves to his right and takes the catch with a slide, then relays it towards Ravindra as deep backward square leg as he was sliding towards the boundary.

But it was followed by a collapse once RCB's captain holed out to the deep, Rajat Patuidar followed soon and so did Glenn Maxwell, both falling for ducks. Virat Kohli and Cameron Green tried to salvage the situations, but they both fell in quick succession and RCB looked down and out at 78 for 5 with Mustafizur on fire and with 4 wickets. Dinesh Karthik, playing at his home ground and Anuj Rawat, trusted to be RCB's extra-batter in this game, though broke ranks, took the ones and twos and then ruthlessly attacked CSK's pacers towards the end. Their 50-ball 95-run stand has given their team a total to defend, but can they defend any score this season? Back for the chase shortly..</p>",

We are slightly under par, so we need to field well and bowl out of our skin. We lost a few wickets in the middle, that hurt us. In the back end, if we connected with a few sixes then that could make the difference. Chasing 182-183 would be a lot more tricky than 173.
