I play cricketing shots, I bat at No. 7 but today I batted at No. 5. The bounce was very good, 200 scored by both teams so the wicket was fantastic. They are the legends of cricket, I don't see the names, I react to the ball and play my shots accordingly. Couldn't get much matches before, last to last year for SRH but the management, the coaching staff here has really backed me and I was very confident.</p>",

They fumbled to score one run off the last 3 balls against Delhi in IPL 2020. They messed up protecting a target when they needed to save 12 off 2 balls. They invested the big bucks to get Shahrukh Khan and Odean Smith to be the designated finishers for them. But who knew that two base price acquisitions, one of those allegedly \"accidental\", would be the missing elixirs for PBKS. They squeezed through a tricky chase at Chepauk last year, and now they\u2019ve done it in the biggest stadium in the world. <b>Is the tide finally turning for PBKS?</b></p>",

But, such is the nature of IPL that it unearths new talent every season. A good fightback from PBKS after losing a couple of games on the trot. The caravan moves on to Hyderabad tomorrow with SRH set to play hosts to CSK. Remember the run-fest in the last game at this venue where more than 500 runs were scored? If the pitch turns out to be a proper highway, fours and sixes will rain once again. Do tune in to catch all the excitement! This is Abhinav Guha signing off on behalf of Ramakrishnan MS, Akshay Maanay, Praveen and Siva. Until then, goodbye and cheers!</p>",
