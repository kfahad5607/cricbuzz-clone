But, such is the nature of IPL that it unearths new talent every season. A good fightback from PBKS after losing a couple of games on the trot. The caravan moves on to Hyderabad tomorrow with SRH set to play hosts to CSK. Remember the run-fest in the last game at this venue where more than 500 runs were scored? If the pitch turns out to be a proper highway, fours and sixes will rain once again. Do tune in to catch all the excitement! This is Abhinav Guha signing off on behalf of Ramakrishnan MS, Akshay Maanay, Praveen and Siva. Until then, goodbye and cheers!</p>",
