It's just working in partnerships. For me when I come in, recognising the new ball is the best time to bat. Rutu was there at the end and did an amazing job. It's having communication with each other, matchups and knowing who you can take down. It is about constantly adapting. Always happy, it's pretty cool to play in front of a crowd like this.

They had a better idea of what to chase being used to playing here, we thought it would have been slower in the second innings, but the wicket was instead better. When you play at night chasing is a no-brainer due to the dew. The pitch gets heated up during summers so I expected the wicket to slow down in the second innings.

Seems like RR were caught in state of not knowing what's the right approach with the bat for a good part of their batting innings. Surely not a 141 pitch and they left at least 25-30 runs. This was a 170 pitch. Evident with the fact how CSK were able to score in the powerplay. With the target being small, Rachin and Mitchell had clear roles of aggressors, while Rutu donned the anchor's role. Both the Kiwis did their job to great effect as they counterattacked most of the RR bowlers. Ashwin got rid of Rachin, while Chahal took care of Mitchell. Moeen came on and nudged around but it was Dube who took Ashwin on to drop the asking rate before being dismissed. The game had an interesting moment with Jadeja being adjudged obstructing the field but CSK had this chase under control and they improved their NRR slightly. Those decimals could have been even better with a slightly earlier finish. Stay tuned for the presentation...</p>",

Jadeja was halfway down the pitch for the second run but Rutu wasn't keen at all. Third man hurled it to Samson who caught the ball had a shy at the bowler's end but the throw hits Jadeja. The third ump's view is that Jadeja was watching the ball and aware of where it was heading. So in his mind he's convinced Jadeja deliberately changed direction. Was that the case though? Need another look at it. Seemed like it was a natural angle that Jadeja was taking. Since he was turning back, he was obviously going to have a look at where the ball was heading. He has a polite enquiry with the ump on seeing the giant screen display OUT and walks off. This is going to be controversial. Anyway, this was building with 2-3 miscommunications between the two batters. Jadeja in the first place didn't have to rush for the second at all. <b>Jadeja obs 5(7)</b></p>",
