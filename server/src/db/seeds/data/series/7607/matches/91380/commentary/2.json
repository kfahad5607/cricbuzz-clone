The chase was never a problem with CSK knowing that they could afford to take their time as the target wasn't too high. It was a luxury KKR didn't have because they had to assess the conditions on the go, without knowing what total would be enough. Unlike the previous couple of games here, this wasn't a 180-200 pitch, and ball-striking wasn't easy. Rather, the situation and the conditions were built perfectly for someone like Ruturaj Gaikwad who could take his time and rely on timing to do the work. There was dew on the outfield too, making it all the more easier for the hosts who cruised home without really breaking a sweat as they ended KKR's unbeaten run in this tournament.</p>",

Wasn't easy (for the new batters) to go after them from the first ball. We were trying to construct the innings, but it didn't fall in place according to the plan. The wicket changed after the powerplay. We were in a comfortable place and we thought 160-170 was a good score, but we lost momentum. We have to go back to the drawing board and got to learn from that. I am glad this happened at the start of the tournament. When we go back, we know our home conditions pretty well.

Wasn't a six-hitting pitch. It is what we've been following through the years. Jaddu always comes after powerplay. With this team I don't need to tell things to anyone. Everyone is in great headspace. You have Mahi bhai still there, you have Fleming still there. I wouldn't say slow start (for him in this tournament). In T20 there are times when you nick off, you get those one-two balls. Sometimes you need little bit of luck to get going. And I feel today it was perfect where I could take my time little bit - something to talk for experts after the game about my strike rate. Good to get the win.</p>",
