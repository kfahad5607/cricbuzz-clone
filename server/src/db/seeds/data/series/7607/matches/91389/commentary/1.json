He started slowly but picked up the pace as the innings progressed, added a 50+ stand with Samad and the pair looked to have given SRH the platform to reach close to 200, but a slew of wickets after the 16th over timeout derailed proceedings. Shahbaz struck a couple of boundaries in the 19th and the last ball six from Unadkat took them past 180. Arshdeep was the pick of the bowlers as he finished with a 4-fer, he picked two wickets apiece in his second and third over, Harshal backed him well and so did Rabada.

I was very happy till the third over but it was a really good day. Just trying to stick to my plans and deliver to the team. (Bowling in the last 5 overs) It's because of the ground dimensions, hitting boundaries straighter is relatively easier than hitting it square. We wanted to take advantage of the bigger square boundary. Even in the first game that we played here, we used a lot of slower bouncers and this game wanted to bowl wide yorkers.</p>",
