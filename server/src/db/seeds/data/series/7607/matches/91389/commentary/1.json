He started slowly but picked up the pace as the innings progressed, added a 50+ stand with Samad and the pair looked to have given SRH the platform to reach close to 200, but a slew of wickets after the 16th over timeout derailed proceedings. Shahbaz struck a couple of boundaries in the 19th and the last ball six from Unadkat took them past 180. Arshdeep was the pick of the bowlers as he finished with a 4-fer, he picked two wickets apiece in his second and third over, Harshal backed him well and so did Rabada. This is a par total on this surface and if SRH's new ball bowlers can get the same help as Punjab Kings then we would have an exciting chase on our hands. Back soon..</p>",
