Last couple of seasons for both KKR and SRH....the lesser said, the better. And just like every other team, the auction acts as a perfect antidote to the bruises of the latest-past. Whether you finish rock-bottom or runner-up, there's always a lingering hope the franchises tend to carry after the conclusion of auction every year. Who else knows that emotion better than KKR and SRH....Is this the season for them? What will change and what won't? Stick around as we build up to the toss of this much-awaited clash...</p>",

The fact that they failed to stitch 3 wins in a row at any stage of the tournament stands as a resounding testimony to their troubles despite a stellar season to Rinku Singh who managed to finish among the top 10 leading-run getters of the season. They did have their moments of high, but the lows were quite telling and left a few scars at the end of the season as they finished 7th for the second time in a row. The good news this year is that, skipper Shreyas Iyer is back and he will be hoping to change the fortunes of the side, joined by two-time IPL champion Gautam Gambhir who will now don the role of a mentor.
