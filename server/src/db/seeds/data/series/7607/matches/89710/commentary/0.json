    "commText": "<p><b>Preview</b> \\n \\nIt's still early days in IPL 2024 and therefore, not a time for teams to take their position on the points table too seriously. Lucknow Super Giants find themselves at the bottom, although they've just played the solitary game in which they endured a narrow defeat to Rajasthan Royals. Meanwhile, Punjab Kings started the tournament with a morale-boosting win over Delhi Capitals but then snatched defeat from the jaws of victory against Royal Challengers Bangalore. \\n \\nKL Rahul's batting position was the major talking point for LSG pre-season, only for the skipper to walk out at his favourite opening spot. The tempo to his innings also was quite similar to what we've been used to from the Karnataka batter but he did look in good touch as the innings progressed. Whether he should continue to bat at the top or move down the order and let a more free-spirited batter take the opening spot continues to be up for debate. \\n \\nLSG have a lot of power in their ranks with the likes of Nicholas Pooran, Marcus Stoinis and Quinton de Kock but the first two continue to be underused. It is a point that they will need to address sooner than later. For Punjab, both games have gone largely to plan, except for the death bowling against RCB which cost Shikhar Dhawan's men a precious win. Compared to previous seasons, PBKS do have a much stronger bowling unit that has most bases covered. \\n \\nHowever, Harshal Patel's patchy form will be a concern, given that he is their designated death bowler. The batting continues to be Punjab's strong suite with a plethora of high-intent powerhitters in their line-up. \\n \\n<b>When:</b> Saturday, March 30 at 19:30 IST \\n \\n<b>Where:</b> Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow \\n \\n<b>What to expect:</b> In the 2023 season, Lucknow was the most bowling-friendly venue with an average first innings score of 148. Both pacers and spinners thrived in unison while batters generally found quickscoring to be a tough task. The surfaces were relaid recently but it is unlikely to be a free-stroking track for batters. \\n \\n<b>Head to Head:</b> The two teams have faced each other three times with LSG having a narrow 2-1 lead over PBKS. \\n \\n<b>Team watch:</b> \\n \\n<b>Lucknow Super Giants</b> \\n \\n<b>Injury/Availability:</b> The LSG camp are without of any injury concerns for this fixture and will have their full squad to pick from. \\n \\n<b>Tactics and Matchups:</b> This could be the game for Devdutt Padikkal to kick-start his LSG career. He has had the better of Kagiso Rabada (48 runs in 29 balls, 0 dismissals) and Sam Curran (32 runs in 20 balls, 0 dismissals). He has fallen thrice to Arshdeep Singh, but has also been able to take him on - smashing 49 off 31 balls faced against the left-armer. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> KL Rahul (c&wk), Quinton de Kock, Ayush Badoni, Nicholas Pooran, Marcus Stoinis/Kyle Mayers, Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohsin Khan, Yash Thakur, Naveen-ul-Haq. [Impact substitute: Deepak Hooda] \\n \\n<b>Punjab Kings</b> \\n \\n<b>Injury/Availability:</b> PBKS also have no concerns when it comes to the fitness of their squad for this fixture. \\n \\n<b>Tactics and Matchups:</b> \\n \\nWhile Padikkal has shown he can take on PBKS' PowerPlay bowlers, KL Rahul has historically been been slow to start off against them. He has scored just 17 runs off 18 balls faced from Arshdeep, while making just 29 off 24 against Sam Curran. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Shikhar Dhawan(c), Jonny Bairstow, Prabhsimran Singh, Jitesh Sharma(wk), Sam Curran, Liam Livingstone, Shashank Singh, Harpreet Brar, Kagiso Rabada, Rahul Chahar. [Impact substitute: Arshdeep Singh] \\n \\n<b>What they said</b> \\n \\n\"The match went till the last over, at the end also we could have bowled a bit better.\" - Shikhar Dhawan is aware of where things have gone wrong for Punjab so far. \\n \\n\"We will learn from the mistakes. We need to find ways to win games of cricket.\" - KL Rahul is confident that his side can bounce back from the loss in the opening game.</p>",

The wicket looks a bit different, but we're confident of doing well. We played a couple of practice games - one on the red soil and another on the black soil, they both played slightly differently. There was a bit of nip and swing on the red soil pitch and it should be interesting to see how it plays tonight. I've known Justin Langer well, I've played under him for Australia as well as in club cricket. It's a calm dressing room, he gives confidence to the players and the assistant coaches.
