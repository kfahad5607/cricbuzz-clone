This season they have rarely used spin except for one or two games. But it's spin that won them the game tonight. The unlikely pairing of Shahbaz and Abhishek the two left-arm spinners ripped through the heart of RR's batting and that made it easy for the pacers. Shahbaz the hero with a three-fer including two in one over and he got the big wickets of Jaiswal and Parag. Abhishek took care of Samson and Hetmyer and that middle-overs slump never allowed RR to get back. The pitch got progressively slower and strokemaking became difficult. Tremendous captaincy from Cummins who realised that spin was the way to go and threw the ball to his tweakers. Also no dew played a huge part as the ball gripped and turned. Only Dhruv Jurel kept fighting and ended up with a good knock. In the end an easy win for SRH and it sets up a rematch of Qualifier 1 on Sunday (26th) for the final. Stay tuned for the presentations...</p>",

We were found short of options in the middle overs against their spin, that's where we lost the game. It's very hard to guess actually when we are expecting some dew or when we are not. The wicket started behaving differently in the second innings, the ball started turning a bit, they used that advantage really well. They bowled their spin in the middle overs against our right-handed batsmen, that's where they were one-up against us. Against their left-arm spin, when the ball was stopping, we could have tried a bit more reverse-sweep or maybe use of the crease a bit more. They also bowled really well. We have had some brilliant games not only this season but from the last three years, it has been a great project for our franchise. We have found some really great talent for the country. Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel and a lot of them are looking really exciting not only for RR but definitely for the Indian cricket team. We have had some great seasons from the last three years. (On Sandeep Sharma) I am really happy for him. By not being picked in the auctions and coming back as a replacement. the way he bowled, he has definitely delivered. If we look at the numbers, Sandeep Sharma in the last two years, he will be the next guy after Bumrah. He has done a great job. (Final) The condition suits both of them, so let's see how they come back again in the powerplay. SRH batsmen are very interesting, they can definitely take the game away. KKR also will be confident, they look very exciting. It'll be a great game, that's what IPL has been giving us for the last 16 years.</p>",

I have been batting well in the last 2 years but it was my bowling that I had to work on and I did it with my dad. It (the pitch) was quicker when we were batting and it started to turn in the second innings, Patty used the spinners well. It was the pressure I have put in all the (practice) sessions that he (Cummins) gave me bowling today. We won the SMAT with Punjab and the momentum came from that, I was ready and worked hard. The message was simple - they gave us the freedom to go and express ourselves. It was one of my dreams to play in the IPL final and it is coming true.</p>",
