Rajasthan Royals did well not to allow them off to a flier and also picked up a couple of wickets in the powerplay. Head was dropped off the first ball of the innings and he took his time today; kept going from one end and found an able partner in Nitish Reddy. The pair added a 50+ partnership for the third wicket with Nitish being the aggressor. Head reached fifty, survived a controversial stumping/run-out but fell off the very next ball. Klaasen came out and took over the aggressor's role, he too added a 50+ stand with Nitish and together they took the total past 200. This surface is not quite a belter with the odd ball stopping and not coming on, so this would be an interesting chase. Back soon with RR's reply..</p>",
