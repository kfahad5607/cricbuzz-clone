Jadeja was promoted to 4 again and he did not make many but it was the Dube-Gaikwad show after that. The left-hander was all power as he marmalised the LSG attack. The slower ball off-cutters on a good length into the pitch did not work at all as it sailed over deep mid-wicket far too many times. Dube's innings was the difference in the end as CSK went past 200. And the crowd got to see MS walk out and smash his only ball to the boundary. And boy did they love that or what.
