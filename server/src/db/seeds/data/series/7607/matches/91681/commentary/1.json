The Bangalore game was a crucial game for us, we did not get the runs, we missed Rishabh Pant in that game. In IPL good Indian players are so important, but then that's the way the sport is. [on JFM] He has brought a lot on the table, I'm happily surprised with the way he has batted. I think this is his first time in the sub-continent, we have played on good wickets at Feroze Shah Kotla, but you still have to put them away. The attitude has been good which is very important for me, he works hard in the nets, doesn't miss training, he is there everyday, even on optional practice he comes. I see very good things for him in this format. Davey is a legend, unfortunately he got injured for a long period time, he missed almost 1 month of the season because of a hand injury. With Ricky around he guided Jake very well. What I like about him is he's hungry, he wants to play well. I know he missed out on the World Cup, Australia should have probably picked him, but that's the way it goes when you have so many good players in Warner, Travis Head and Mitch Marsh at 3, you will obviously miss out. But he's just 22 and he has got a long career and I'm sure he will be up and ready. For us, he is a gamechanger and that's what you need in this format. We will see how it goes. Keep it simple and win and then see where it goes.</p>",

Bishnoi through the middle overs kept it tight and bowled it flat and fast outside off, beating the batters on the cut a lot.
