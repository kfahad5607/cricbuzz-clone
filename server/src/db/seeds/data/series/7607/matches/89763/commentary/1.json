What an assault on Nortje in that last over. 32 off it and MI have posted an imposing 234. Rohit and Ishan set the tone earlier, especially the former. He batted as he always does - proactively in the powerplay. But Axar ended his innings on 49 and there was a streak of quick wickets which saw MI slip to 121/4 but Hardik promoting himself to 4 was joined by Tim David and they added another stand. And then the late heroics of Shepherd added the icing on the cake. That assault from Shepherd has provided MI with the cushion they need. A stiff chase ahead for DC. Can they get there? Back for the reply in 5 minutes...</p>",
