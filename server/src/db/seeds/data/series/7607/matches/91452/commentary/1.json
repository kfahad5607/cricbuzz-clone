Looked very clumsy, did he drag himself out of the crease? They're checking for the caught behind first and it's a flat line on UltraEdge. Onto the stumping now - Pant has dropped the ball, but did it go on and fall on the wicket? Or was his gloves that disturbed the stumps first? It's a tough one for the 3rd umpire - he's checking with several replays, Shahrukh Khan is definitely short of his ground and the umpire reckons that there's gap between the glove and the wicket, so it's the ball which has hit the stumps and the super sub falls for a duck. A lucky wicket for the Capitals, but they'll not complain one bit - dragged flat and down leg, Shahrukh was shaping for the pull and the momentum took him out of the crease, Pant couldn't gather it cleanly, but he gets lucky. <b>Shahrukh Khan st Pant b Tristan Stubbs 0(1)</b> </p>",

At the toss, Pant had a slight bit of hesitation before opting to bowl, but his bowlers proved too good for the GT batters who looked clueless on occasions. You could perhaps argue that the pitch is on the slower side with the odd ball keeping low, but majority of the GT batters were victims of their own-decision making and it might eventually hurt their NRR very badly. But before building thoughts on NRR, can DC brush this aside without any hiccups? Back in 15 for their reply...</p>",
