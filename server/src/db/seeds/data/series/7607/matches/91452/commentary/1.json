No, he's OUT by a couple of yards and the Titans slip further into trouble. Not sure if it was a good call, but it was Sai Sudharsan's call and he has no one but himself to blame, was on the back-foot as he punched one to the right of mid-wicket and set-off - Sumit was quick on the ball, it bounces nicely into his right hand, he then runs forward and throws down the stumps with an under-arm shy, catching Sudharsan well short. <b>Sai Sudharsan run out (Sumit Kumar) 12(9) [4s-2]</b></p>",

Looked very clumsy, did he drag himself out of the crease? They're checking for the caught behind first and it's a flat line on UltraEdge. Onto the stumping now - Pant has dropped the ball, but did it go on and fall on the wicket? Or was his gloves that disturbed the stumps first? It's a tough one for the 3rd umpire - he's checking with several replays, Shahrukh Khan is definitely short of his ground and the umpire reckons that there's gap between the glove and the wicket, so it's the ball which has hit the stumps and the super sub falls for a duck. A lucky wicket for the Capitals, but they'll not complain one bit - dragged flat and down leg, Shahrukh was shaping for the pull and the momentum took him out of the crease, Pant couldn't gather it cleanly, but he gets lucky. <b>Shahrukh Khan st Pant b Tristan Stubbs 0(1)</b> </p>",

You could perhaps argue that the pitch is on the slower side with the odd ball keeping low, but majority of the GT batters were victims of their own-decision making and it might eventually hurt their NRR very badly.
