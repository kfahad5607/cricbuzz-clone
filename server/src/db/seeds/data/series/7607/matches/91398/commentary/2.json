    "commText": "<p><b>Bumrah, POTM:</b> I'm very happy with the outcome. But I will not say I had always thought of taking a five-for. Wicket was sticking in the first 10 overs. I observed that quickly and tried to use it to my advantage. One of those days where things went in my favour and catches went to hand. Very happy with the contribution. In this format, it's anyway very harsh on the bowlers so you have to have all kinds of skills. This is what I train for. Come this situation, I should have different options. I should not be a one-trick pony, and can't just rely on yorker because there will be days where my execution is off so I can rely on other deliveries. Everyone is doing research and data, so people start to line you up. So I wanted to have different skills. Bowling is tough because you will have to take a beating, you will have to have bad days to learn from it. What I've done in the past, whenever I've had bad days, I've watched videos the next day to see what didn't work, why it didn't work, what is the way I've been playing. All of these things, you have to be with the curve. Nowadays, you just cannot come on the day and say okay I'll do this, maybe this will work. For me, preparation is always the key. When you prepare hard, you put yourself under pressure in the nets. You bowl to batters in the nets who hit big sixes, find out how you react to pressure. Then you start finding answers. That is very very important for me - to keep pushing yourself in training. Then on game day, you have answers that okay when I had similar pressure in training, I had answers. I do my research and see where the batter is strong. Sometimes the wicket is sticky, you don't always need to bowl the yorker. You can use the bouncer, you can use the slower ball. So you don't need to use all tricks on one day. You have to understand where the game is going, what the wicket is. There's no ego in this format. Even if you can bowl 145kph, but the wicket demands slower balls then you have to do that. All of these things are important. It's not just one-trick pony - aim at the stumps and go pole hunting.</p>",

It gives me a cushion as well. At the same point, if someone is having a bad day, it helps us to cover those overs. The way Ro and Kishan batted, giving the platform, it was important for us to finish it early. We didn't speak about it. That's the beauty of this team, players know what the situation is. As soon as we saw the target get lesser, we thought we might as well finish it early for NRR. Blessed to have Bumrah in my side. He does it over and over again. Any time I ask him to bowl, he comes and does what he does. He practices a lot. Before doing anything in the game, he makes sure he practices in the nets. The amount of experience and confidence he has is tremendous. I did tell him when he scored the fifty that welcome back (Surya). Always good to have Surya in your team with the areas he hits. I've been opposition captain as well against him, it's tough to put field for him. Some place he hits, I've never seen batters hit there. (I'll do) Whatever the situation requires - last game I had to take some time, and this game's scenario was different. I've always been a fan of whatever the situation demands.</p>",

We knew dew would be a factor, we might have needed to make 250+, but they made 196 look very less. You know when there's dew coming, you'll have to bat big, the ball was very wet, it was changed a few times and the bowlers struggled. We also lost a few key moments, we were going well when myself and Patidar were out in the middle with that partnership, but they did come back well. Every time you see him with the ball in his hand (on Jasprit Bumrah), you think you'll have to put him under pressure. But he has so many skills, bowls well under pressure, he bowls with the same action and has a lot of variations. I think he has become even better under the guidance of Lasith Malinga. We would have loved if he was part of our team (smiles). We will have to find ways with the bat, get those big scores, we know our bowling is not our strongest suit, but we'll have to find ways to manage it, we'll have to be creative, go hard with the bat and make most of the first 4-5 overs with the bat.</p>",

You look at the figures of all the bowlers today from both teams, and it's hard not to feel sorry for them. But then you look at Bumrah with figures of 5/21. No wonder Siraj is bowing to him before giving him a big hug as the teams meet for the handshakes. Different planet he's from, and he didn't allow RCB to get away in the death overs.
