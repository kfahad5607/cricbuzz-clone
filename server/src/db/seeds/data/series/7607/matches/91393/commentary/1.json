Buttler failed tonight and Jaiswal again did not last beyond the powerplay - he has not done that this season. Enter Samson and Riyan Parag. Parag was dropped twice by Wade early on off Rashid Khan and that proved costly. The duo settled down and then began the rebuilding work. Parag took heavy toll on Noor, smashing him on the leg-side for three sixes. The stand was worth 130 and GT after a good start couldn't get rid of them. At the end Hetmyer hit a six and ensured his contribution. Once again RR's skipper Samson came good - his third fifty in 5 games and 196 is a good score. RR have a good bowling lineup and they will be backing themselves. Back for the chase in 5 minutes...</p>",
