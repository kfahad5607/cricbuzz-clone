    "commText": "<p><b>Preview</b> by <b>Hariprasad Sadanandan :</b> \\n \\nNew season, same old worries - in a nutshell that's how Royal Challengers Bengaluru have fared in their four games so far. With just one win, Faf du Plessis' men are staring down the barrel as far as their playoff dreams are concerned. The batting has lacked consistency while the bowling has been woefully short of clarity in execution. With a familiar scenario of crisis, RCB get set for a tough assignment against Rajasthan Royals who are one of the two unbeaten sides this season at the moment. That the encounter is at Jaipur makes things further complicated for the visitors, given RR's potent home record. \\n \\nRajasthan Royals have started the season with a bang. Three wins out of three and the manner of the victories will please the management no end. The bowling continues to be their stronger suit while the resurgence of Riyan Parag gives an extra dimension to the batting unit. The Assam batter's form augurs well for the team with Jos Buttler and Yashasvi Jaiswal yet to fire. The duo are bound to strike form sooner than later and that will make the hosts' batting ominous. The 2023 season saw RR stumbling at home but have gone back to their usual winning ways at Jaipur this season. \\n \\nGiven the big dimensions of the venue and its history of having two-paced pitches more often than not, RCB's batting will have their task cut out. Most of their batters prefer to have pace on the ball for strokeplay and RR's bowlers will be aware of the loopholes to exploit. Bangalore's bowlers might have some respite due to the conditions but they would also have to contend with Rajasthan's formidable batting unit. It is this sub-plot that could potentially decide the outcome of the game. \\n \\n<b>When:</b> Saturday, April 6, 19:30 IST \\n \\n<b>Where:</b> Rajasthan Royals vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur \\n \\n<b>What to expect:</b> Contrary to the historical data, the two games in Jaipur this season have both seen 180-plus scores by the team batting first. One came in an afternoon game while the other was an evening contest. Batting became easier in the evening game and it could be a trend again. It should be another batting-friendly surface but could still have something in it to keep the bowlers interested. \\n \\n<b>Head to Head:</b> RR hold a slender 15-12 lead over RCB from 30 games with three no-results also in the mix. \\n \\n<b>Team watch:</b> \\n \\n<b>Rajasthan Royals</b> \\n \\n<b>Injury/Availability:</b> All is well in the RR camp when it comes to the fitness of their squad with no casualties reported. \\n \\n<b>Tactics and Matchups:</b> Sandeep Sharma loves playing RCB, tallying 26 wickets from 18 games at a frugal economy rate of 7.94 and a strike rate of 15.6. While he has historically operated with the new ball and at the death in equal proportion, RR seem to have given him a full-fledged death-over specialist role this season. However, Sandeep has an impeccable record against Virat Kohli, having dismissed RCB's premier batter seven times in 67 deliveries! Sandeep has also dislodged Glenn Maxwell twice in 15 deliveries. Whether his role will be flexible due to this data in this contest is anybody's guess. Given the convincing nature of their win against Mumbai Indians, the Royals should field an unchanged side. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Jos Buttler, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson (c/wk), Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Shimron Hetmyer, Ravichandran Ashwin, Yuzvendra Chahal, Nandre Burger, Avesh Khan, Trent Boult. [Impact substitute - Shubham Dubey] \\n \\n<b>Royal Challengers Bangalore</b> \\n \\n<b>Injury/Availability:</b> All players are expected to be available for the game in Jaipur \\n \\n<b>Tactics and Matchups:</b> Jos Buttler might not be in form so far but the threat he carries is known to all. Particularly at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium where he has racked up runs for fun. Fortunately for RCB, they have two bowlers who have the wood over the English white-ball captain. Fellow Englishman Reece Topley has removed Buttler four times in 42 deliveries while Mohammed Siraj has also accounted for the opener twice in 29 deliveries. This new-ball battle could go a long way in deciding RCB's bowling fortunes in the game. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Glenn Maxwell, Cameron Green, Anuj Rawat (wk), Dinesh Karthik, Mayank Dagar, Reece Topley, Mohammed Siraj, Yash Dayal. [Impact substitute - Mahipal Lomror] \\n \\n<b>Did you know ?</b> \\n \\n- Jos Buttler's highest score in his last six IPL innings is 13 which he registered in the last game against Mumbai Indians. The Englishman ended IPL 2023 with three successive ducks and the new season hasn't been too different so far. \\n \\n<b>What they said:</b> \\n \\n\"You need two guys to bat through and get a partnership which we were not able to do. We need the strong characters in the dressing room to put their hand up.\" - <b>Faf du Plessis</b> wants his side's experienced men to step up in the batting department \\n \\n\"Nothing has changed, just that I have simplified things. Before I would think about things too much, this year the goal is simple, watch the ball, hit the ball\" - <b>Riyan Parag</b> reveals a simple secret to his redemption</p>",
