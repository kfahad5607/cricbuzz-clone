There were some terrible shots played and there was an air of panic amongst all the supporters at the Chinnaswamy.

I wasn't padded up, I wasn't mentally ready, I was just chilling. And then, things happened and then I had to pad up. I was a touch late but I just managed to make it. It's a very different sort of pressure, it's one thing chasing down totals in an interesting way and all you need to think about is hitting boundaries. But if there's a lot of time and you need to make sure that playing sensibly is also the need of the hour, then your basic cricketing skills come through, how you are able to hit boundaries without taking risks. Over a period of time, that's been my strengths, so I backed myself to that. The pitch was initially good to bowl on. Being under the covers for so long, there was a bit of moisture. It was sticky, tough to start on, good toss to win and we bowled very well. Got to give credit to the bowlers. No matter what the pitch is, to keep the score under the score we kept at the end of six overs is quite a task and I thought they bowled beautifully today. The way Faf and Virat batted, I don't think you could have played the some kind of shots if you were batting first. Also, the skill that both of them have, I enjoyed how they went about things. (Chat with Swapnil while facing Noor) I told Swapnil to play for the ball that comes in so that the one that goes away remains a dot ball. It looks good but doesn't get the wicket. He asked me if sweep was a good option and I said, \"If you feel sweep is a good option, back yourself to do it but commit to the shot, don't be half-hearted.\" Then he executed those two sweep shots which were very good and that was the need of the hour in a way.</p>",

Got the success today after practising a lot with the new ball this year. Reminded me of last year. When I woke up in the morning, I thought I wouldn't be able to play and that I should take rest. When I woke up, I manifested what I wanted to do and that's exactly what happened. Not easy to switch between red and white ball cricket. You need to give your 110% every ball here.</p>",

    "commText": "<p>Big win for RCB in the context of the tournament. They keep their playoffs hopes alive although it is fairly slim. That win also takes them off the bottom of the table and up to number 7. That'll boost their confidence because it felt like they'd been rooted to the bottom for an eternity. On the flip side, this loss will sting for GT. Twice in two games now that they've been trumped by RCB and their own playoffs hopes now hang by a slim thread. Three games left for both teams and RCB have done their NRR wonders with today's win and that's something that could come into play as we head into the back end of the tournament. Right, that's it from us for tonight. This is <b>Anurag Hegde</b> signing off on behalf of <b>Nikhil JD, Abhinand Raghavendran</b> and <b>Siva</b>. Take care and goodbye.</p>",
