Despite losing Warner off the opening over, Fraser-McGurk continued to bat on his merry way but a freakish run-out (palmed over the bowler in his followthrough) in the 3rd over put a huge dent which DC failed to recover. Hope and Axar stitched a 56-run stand for the 5th wicket, and, unfortunately for DC, they lost the wickets of Hope and Stubbs in quick succession to make thigs that much more difficult for them. Axar's lone battle only helped in bringing down the defeat margin as RCB romped home to keep their playoff hopes alive. Hang around for the post-match comments...</p>",
