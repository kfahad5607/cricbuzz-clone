The two were seen having a long conversation during the rain break, and while Buttler didn't last too long after the resumption, his younger partner carried on all the way. MI's decision at the toss of batting first didn't work out the way they'd have wanted. They got the worst of the conditions, with the ball stopping in the first innings, and then coming on much better in the second as the rain came down and outfield became damp. Their fielding was shoddy as well with two chances going down, and Jaiswal made them pay heavily.</p>",

We had to keep it within the stumps (while bowling). Early on in the powerplay, we gave a lot of width and I don't think it was our best day in the field as well. Overall, we did not put the right foot on the park and eventually they outplayed us. After the game, it's not the right time to go to the players, everyone is professional, they know their roles. What we can do is learn from this game and the mistakes which we have made, rectify\u00a0it and make sure that we don't make it. Progression is very important. Within the team, individually, we will have to accept our flaws and maybe work on those. I don't believe much in chip and chop, I like to back players and the focus would always be to play good cricket, sticking to our plans and making sure that we don't make the basic errors.

    "commText": "<p><b>Sandeep, POTM:</b> Got fit day before yesterday only. First game after fitness, feeling good. Pitch was on slower side and lower side, so my plan was to keep bowling variations and cutters. If you're bowling in the end, you have to have big heart. Have seen in the IPL, bowlers are under the pump. Need to have big heart and keep executing plans. As you know, I went unsold two years ago. Came in as a replacement. So I'm enjoying every game.</p>",

    "commText": "<p>A five-for on return from injury for Sandeep Sharma, and a hundred from Yashasvi Jaiswal later in the evening. Those were two outstanding individual performances that contributed heavily to the win for RR who keep going from strength to strength. Today the decision at the toss worked in their favour as well, with MI opting to bat first. Samson, knowing the conditions, was happy with that result. And he'll be a lot more happier with the overall outcome. That's it from us here. This is Sagar Chawla signing off on behalf of Harish, Abhinand Raghavendran and Abhinav Guha. Goodbye!</p>",
