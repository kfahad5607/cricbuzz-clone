They have slipped to the fifth position on the points table courtesy a 98-run loss and that has dented their net run-rate. Things are getting tight mid-table as three teams are now locked in at 12 points. Meanwhile, KKR are on a roll and have won three games in a row to rise to the top of the table. Their net run-rate has received a real boost and that augurs well for them going ahead. They have put one step into the playoffs but will be eager to keep the acceleration going. That ends our coverage for tonight. This is Abhinav Guha signing off on behalf of Abhinand Raghavendran, Raju Peethala and Praveen. Until next time, goodnight and take care!</p>",

When you are chasing a big total, you are trying to go too hard and you end up losing wickets. Just a poor performance overall. We didn't (hit our lengths on a consistent basis), just been a poor performance overall with bat, ball and in the field. Sunil Narine and Phil Salt, in the powerplay, we've seen how they bat and they do put a lot of pressure on the opposition. Our young bowlers couldn't handle that kind of pressure and he hit some really good shots. That's how IPL is, you come up against really good players and that's when your character is tested. We weren't up to the mark. The wicket was really good, felt like a pretty true wicket, there was a bit of bounce if you bowled hard lengths and back of a lengths, but nothing out of the ordinary and it didn't seem like a pitch that was really bad. 235 was probably 20 or 30 runs above par and our batting performance was really poor. When you're chasing such a big score, you're under pressure, it's always hard. We prepare well in advance and talk about the opposition batters, we know our conditions here and we do spend a little bit of time talking to the bowlers and talking to the batters trying to see what kind of plans we need to come up with. Once we come here, it's about execution and we went wrong in that part. Bowlers tried their best but the young group really ... the sooner you learn, the better it for the team. We've made a couple of mistakes when we've come up against batters like Sunil and anyone that's powerful. That type of intimidation puts pressure on our bowlers. That'll be the chat once we get back to the dressing room - move on from this game, see where we went wrong and try and get better. This is our last home game for us, so we are on the road for the next three games. It's pretty clear for us, if you want to get to the top four, you got to win all the games. That will give us a little bit of freedom to go out there and be a little bit more fearless, little bit brave to take on the game.</p>",

Once the visitors posted 235 on the board (highest T20 score at this venue), they had their tails up at the halfway stage. Kulkarni was nipped out by Starc quite early, courtesy a brilliant catch from Ramandeep. Rahul and Stoinis played a few eye-catchy strokes and stitched a 50-run stand. But once the former departed, things went pear-shaped for LSG as they kept losing wickets in a jiffy. There was some turn available for Narine and Chakaravarthy and they bowled with a lot of discipline. Russell took two important wickets of Stoinis and Pooran and that effectively killed the game. Rana was also on the money and picked up a 3-fer. A forgettable day at the office for LSG. Stick around for the presentations...</p>",
