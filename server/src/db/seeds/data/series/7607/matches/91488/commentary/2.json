Chasing 143, Gujarat lost Saha inside the powerplay once again. Sai Sudharsan joined his skipper and the equation was tailor-made for the duo. Shubman Gill was looking in good touch as well but his miscued loft resulted in GT stuttering a bit. Livingstone removed Gill and Miller to bring back life into this contest. Sai Sudharsan and Azmatullah were dismissed in quick succession and the Titans slipped from 77/1 to 103/4. With 38 runs needed off four overs, the game was pretty much in the balance. That's when I0$ He struck a couple of boundaries against Brar and Rabada conceded 20 runs off the 18th over which extinguished Punjab's hopes.
