Opting to bat, Punjab got off to a brisk start, thanks to Prabhsimran's blitz in the powerplay, but the troika of GT spinners ruled the roost in the middle overs as they finished with combined bowling figures of 7/68. Chasing 143, Gujarat lost Saha inside the powerplay once again. Sai Sudharsan joined his skipper and the equation was tailor-made for the duo. Shubman Gill was looking in good touch as well but his miscued loft resulted in GT stuttering a bit. Livingstone removed Gill and Miller to bring back life into this contest. Sai Sudharsan and Azmatullah were dismissed in quick succession and the Titans slipped from 77/1 to 103/4. With 38 runs needed off four overs, the game was pretty much in the balance. That's when I0$ He struck a couple of boundaries against Brar and Rabada conceded 20 runs off the 18th over which extinguished Punjab's hopes. Harshal picked a couple of wickets in the penultimate over but that only delayed the proceedings.</p>",

The Afghanistan spinners are world class bowlers and Sai Kishore bowled really well, credit to them. That is the third time we have used that pitch, anything above 160 would have been a par total but we still fought well.
