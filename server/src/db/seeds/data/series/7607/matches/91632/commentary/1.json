But, it was a full-toss from Ashwin which got rid of him. An unfortunate run-out of Hope occurred in quick succession. Porel took over and started finding boundaries consistently. Axar played the supporting role to him but couldn't convert his start. Pant also misfired and fell while playing a poor shot. Ashwin bowled a brilliant spell tonight and ended with miserly figures of 4-0-24-3. It was the cameo from Stubbs in the death overs which gave DC the much-needed momentum. Chahal wasn't his usual self as he couldn't utilize the helpful conditions on offer properly. 222 is certainly gettable but the teams batting first have won on every occasion so far. There's some turn and grip available and Axar and Kuldeep have a good amount of runs to play with. Will be an interesting battle...</p>",
