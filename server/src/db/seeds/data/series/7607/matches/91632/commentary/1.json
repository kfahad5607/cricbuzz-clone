Samson chose to bowl after winning the toss but Fraser McGurk went beserk in the powerplay to put the opposition under immense pressure. The Australian scored a 19-ball fifty. But, it was a full-toss from Ashwin which got rid of him. An unfortunate run-out of Hope occurred in quick succession. Porel took over and started finding boundaries consistently. Axar played the supporting role to him but couldn't convert his start. Pant also misfired and fell while playing a poor shot. Ashwin bowled a brilliant spell tonight and ended with miserly figures of 4-0-24-3. It was the cameo from Stubbs in the death overs which gave DC the much-needed momentum. Chahal wasn't his usual self as he couldn't utilize the helpful conditions on offer properly. 222 is certainly gettable but the teams batting first have won on every occasion so far. There's some turn and grip available and Axar and Kuldeep have a good amount of runs to play with. Will be an interesting battle...</p>",

Sometimes you find yourself wanting to search for more and more. This IPL season has been quite exceptional (in terms of being pushed to the limit). I have been working on different angles and releases. Got a couple of balls to hold. (On the total) Wouldn't say it is a par score. You need to bat really well, they got Kuldeep and Axar so how you manage them is key. You are probably going to see more baseballers playing cricket. I think in modern day T20 those good balls aren't good balls anymore (chuckles).</p>",
