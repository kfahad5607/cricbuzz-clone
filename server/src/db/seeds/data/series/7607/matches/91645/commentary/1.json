Once the base was set and Cam got a few boundaries away, I thought I had to go again. Surface was pretty dry underneath, and there was some grass coverage as well. If you saw Faf and me got done by lack of pace off the pitch. There was a two-paced feel with the new ball, which I think is a great opportunities for our bowlers to make early inroads and exploit that swing out there. We thought anything over 230 would be a good total here. That was the only mindset. That was a hell of an over from Harshal in the last over otherwise we would've been 250-plus. Difficult to analyse someone in one game (talking about Kaverappa). He has swing in his hand. That's the thing when you're playing your first game and people haven't played you - you get away with it. You try to figure out variations and stuff like that. Kudos to him - he bowled good areas.
