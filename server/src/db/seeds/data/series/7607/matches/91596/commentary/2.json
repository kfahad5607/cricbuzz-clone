When I started hitting the ball well, two more wickets fell and I thought I have to play the anchor role. This is the fourth or fifth time Manish has padded up. This time he got to bat. Rather than sending Russell and Ramandeep higher, better to have Manish who can play the anchor role. Ball was holding and it was a two paced wicket. I try to be a smarter cricketer. Would've been easy for me to go after Piyush Chawla and the fast bowlers. Team needed me to be there till the end. I've been a huge fan of dada (Sourav Ganguly). Went to ask him about my stance and technical aspects. Was a fruitful conversation. It's coming through in my stance and other aspects in the nets.</p>",

Manish has been eyeing an opportunity from Day 1. Today he got it. We got to a commendable total. All I had to say to the boys was we can defend it with our bowling lineup. They were unreal to be honest (on the two spinners). Absolutely spot on in terms of execution with line and lengths.

Seven wins in 10 games now, taking them ever closer to qualification. MI, on the other hand, are all but out. The pitch today was two paced and sticky, so the target of 170 wasn't a straightforward one. However, KKR had to overcome quite a bit of dew in the second innings and they did a fabulous job, especially their spinners. Chakaravarthy and Narine, both of them finished with identical figures of 2/22, including some big wickets in the first half of the chase which put KKR on top as MI were reduced to 71/6. Things got tight as Surya played a brilliant knock. But before he could tilt the balance, he perished to a full toss from Russell and MI didn't have much left in the tank after that.</p>",
