He desperately needed that after a lackluster showing in this tournament so far. More importantly for KKR, they've staved off a late surge from the hosts to get the two points and consolidate second spot on the table. Seven wins in 10 games now, taking them ever closer to qualification. MI, on the other hand, are all but out. The pitch today was two paced and sticky, so the target of 170 wasn't a straightforward one. However, KKR had to overcome quite a bit of dew in the second innings and they did a fabulous job, especially their spinners. Chakaravarthy and Narine, both of them finished with identical figures of 2/22, including some big wickets in the first half of the chase which put KKR on top as MI were reduced to 71/6. Things got tight as Surya played a brilliant knock. But before he could tilt the balance, he perished to a full toss from Russell and MI didn't have much left in the tank after that.</p>",

[on if it spun in the 2nd innings] Not much in the 2nd innings as there was dew. We planned extensively for this match and it worked out. They did tell me that the ball is stopping but as I got to bowl, it was not stopping and it was going on well. Sunny is a legend, he has been bowling the same way from I don't know when. Glad to be bowling alongside him. This is a very special win for we were down and out in the first innings, the way Pandey and Venkatesh pulled off the game from their shoulders was great.
