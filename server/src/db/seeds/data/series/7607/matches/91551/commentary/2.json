The TN duo of Shahrukh & Sai stitched a superb partnership and then Miller applied the finishing touches to take the team's total to 200. I0$ was always going to be the key battle of this encounter. When Sai Kishore removed Faf, Gujarat would have fancied their chances. Noor bowled better than what his bowling figures say, especially to Jacks but the latter was lucky to get away. And once Jacks found his rhythm, there was no stopping him. RCB are still at the bottom of the table but they have now won two in a row. Gujarat, on the other hand, have lost two on the bounce. That's it from this game. There's one more lined up - I1$ Switch tabs to follow the action. For now, it's goodbye from <b>Abhinand Raghavendran</b>, <b>Pradeep Krishnamurthy</b>, <b>Nikhil Jadhav</b> and <b>Harish</b>.</p>",

Once I got one away off Mohit, I relaxed, got into my innings and then just trusted myself. Next game, hopefully I do that earlier. (Batting with Kohli) It's amazing, he's a legend of the game and is someone everyone looks up to. To spend some time in the middle is a great feeling a huge learning curve. When I go away from the IPL, I'll learn so much from batting with him and playing with him. I'll try to take it all on board. I need to be a bit more adaptable at the beginning of my innings and get myself in a little bit quicker. I was lucky today because 17 off 17 is not going to win you many games.

My role completely changed as soon as he got that big over off Mohit, for good, I was glad to be watching the game from the other end. I mean, I thought\u00a0we could win the game in 19 overs, but to finish it in 16 overs was an outstanding effort. I think it was one of the better T20I hundreds one would ever see, I was just happy\u00a0to watch it closely from the other end. The wicket was pretty good, I mean towards the later half of their innings, it started settling down and that was probably the reason why both teams wanted to bowl first., That was evident, the temperature\u00a0went down, it got cooler and as the wicket settled down, the ball started to come nicely onto the bat. I was just having fun out there, hitting boundaries whenever needed. We never allowed the run-rate to go under 10 rpo at any point of the chase and to do that in the end what Jacks did. <b>Not really, all the people who talk about strike-rates and me not playing spin well are the ones talking about this stuff. For me, it's about winning the games for the team and there's a reason why you've done it for 15 years, you've done this day in and day out, you've won games for your teams, I'm not quite sure that if you haven't been in that situation yourself, to sit and talk about the game from the box. For me, people can talk about their assumptions day in and day out, but those who have done day in and day out, they know what's happening and it's a kind of muscle memory for me now</b>. We wanted to step up for ourselves, play for\u00a0our self respect. We can't be playing the way we played in the first half of the tournament, we wanted to see the ball as well, we are attacking way more, the fielders are putting their bodies on the line, that's the way we want to play. We haven't been up to standards so far except the last two games, but we just want to continue the same way, we have a great atmosphere in the dressing room.
