My role completely changed as soon as he got that big over off Mohit, for good, I was glad to be watching the game from the other end. I mean, I thought\u00a0we could win the game in 19 overs, but to finish it in 16 overs was an outstanding effort. I think it was one of the better T20I hundreds one would ever see, I was just happy\u00a0to watch it closely from the other end. The wicket was pretty good, I mean towards the later half of their innings, it started settling down and that was probably the reason why both teams wanted to bowl first., That was evident, the temperature\u00a0went down, it got cooler and as the wicket settled down, the ball started to come nicely onto the bat. I was just having fun out there, hitting boundaries whenever needed. We never allowed the run-rate to go under 10 rpo at any point of the chase and to do that in the end what Jacks did. <b>Not really, all the people who talk about strike-rates and me not playing spin well are the ones talking about this stuff. For me, it's about winning the games for the team and there's a reason why you've done it for 15 years, you've done this day in and day out, you've won games for your teams, I'm not quite sure that if you haven't been in that situation yourself, to sit and talk about the game from the box. For me, people can talk about their assumptions day in and day out, but those who have done day in and day out, they know what's happening and it's a kind of muscle memory for me now</b>. We wanted to step up for ourselves, play for\u00a0our self respect. We can't be playing the way we played in the first half of the tournament, we wanted to see the ball as well, we are attacking way more, the fielders are putting their bodies on the line, that's the way we want to play. We haven't been up to standards so far except the last two games, but we just want to continue the same way, we have a great atmosphere in the dressing room. We want to play for ourselves, have some self respect as to why we're playing at this level and also for the fans who've been supporting us.</p>",

When we bowled first, we felt like it certainly was a score that we could chase, obviously not 16 overs. It feels like we've made some real progress in both departments. We were way off in the beginning of the tournament, but it feels like there's confidence in the group and you can see that in both bowling and batting. The guys are doing a really good job. At the moment and the way T20 game is ... when you look at the score and you think, \"bowlers, what are you doing?\" But it's not actually the case. The game has changed so much. Especially that game against Kolkata, for me was probably a line in the sand moment for us as a team where the score was 220 but I felt like that's the first time we bowled to what we wanted to bowl this season. The bowlers took some great confidence from that night and you can see the following performance has been really good. We are doing the basics much better now.</p>",

I struggled early on, but Virat kept his intensity up and gave me the chance to find my rhythm. Once we had the time-out, we said, \"let's get two really good overs here and we win the game.\" Once that happened, I just kept going and amazing feeling right now. I was trying to be positive (against spin early on), was just struggling. I was trying to overhit the ball, probably little bit tensed. Once I got one away off Mohit, I relaxed, got into my innings and then just trusted myself. Next game, hopefully I do that earlier. (Batting with Kohli) It's amazing, he's a legend of the game and is someone everyone looks up to. To spend some time in the middle is a great feeling a huge learning curve. When I go away from the IPL, I'll learn so much from batting with him and playing with him. I'll try to take it all on board. I need to be a bit more adaptable at the beginning of my innings and get myself in a little bit quicker. I was lucky today because 17 off 17 is not going to win you many games. The other guys around me saved me earlier today.</p>",
