(On coach Andy Flower) A seasoned campaigner, brings that experience. (On auction) Really good, our bowling resources fit well. Got more backup. Hopefully, injuires don't bother us too much. (On team combination) Alzarri Joseph comes in tonight, got a few spinners in the middle. And since we are batting first, we'll see how it goes</p>",
