Abhishek also departed cheaply as he holed out to covers to Arora. The Australian should have got his second wicket as well when Tripathi was trapped in front but KKR didn't review. But, Starc was relentless and picked up two more wickets in two balls to push SRH into a tangle at 39/4. It was in the 9th over that SRH got some momentum with Narine leaking 18 runs. But soon after that, Chakravarthy struck in his first over to send the dangerous Klaasen packing. Tripathi continued to play well from the other end and scored a fine fifty but a needless run-out sent him packing. The Impact sub flopped and the wickets continued to tumble. Chakravarthy once again bowled a top spell to choke SRH. Cummins played a good cameo but 159 is below-par on a surface which is pretty good for batting. The odd-ball is sticking and there's some extra bounce too but KKR have the firepower to chase this down...</p>",
