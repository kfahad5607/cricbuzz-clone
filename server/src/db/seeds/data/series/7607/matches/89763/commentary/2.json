But Stubbs made a valiant attempt all the way to the end with no support from his mates since his arrival at the crease. 235 was always tough even if was at the Wankhede but DC didn't bat well. Warner had a soft dismissal. Abhishek who came at No. 3 played shots but couldn't go at a brisk pace. Shaw played a good hand with a fifty. Stubbs was sent ahead of Pant and he was outstanding today, hitting even tough balls over the ropes. Bumrah was a massive influence for MI. If not for his yorkers and cunning off-speed deliveries, DC could have got a lot closer or even crossed the line because the rest were being taken for runs. Pant couldn't put bat on ball properly and Stubbs was left too much to do. In the end, Hardik and his team finally got their smiles back and they do a lap of honour to the kids who have turned up today. Stay tuned for the post-match presentation...</p>",

Yes, we had a few bad overs (with the ball), but it does happen at times. The bowlers needed to bowl into the wicket, slower ones and the variations were important. The bowlers needed to understand the conditions well. I think we need to improve on a few areas - death-over bowling and our batting as well.</p>",

We were looking towards that one over, we know he's very powerful and has the ability to clear boundaries. We've been talking with the coaches on all departments (of the game), as a keeper, it's important to get the field placings right.
