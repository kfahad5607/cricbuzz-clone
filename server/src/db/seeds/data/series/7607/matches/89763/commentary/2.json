Belief and backing each other is the attitude out there. Everyone believed we need just one win. It was an amazing start today, always wonderful to get 70 odd in 6 overs. The way everyone chipped in when the opportunity was coming was good to see. That was some hitting na (On Romario's heroics). He won us the game. Difference was Romario v Delhi Capitals. I like him.

Warner had a soft dismissal. Abhishek who came at No. 3 played shots but couldn't go at a brisk pace. Shaw played a good hand with a fifty. Stubbs was sent ahead of Pant and he was outstanding today, hitting even tough balls over the ropes. Bumrah was a massive influence for MI. If not for his yorkers and cunning off-speed deliveries, DC could have got a lot closer or even crossed the line because the rest were being taken for runs. Pant couldn't put bat on ball properly and Stubbs was left too much to do. In the end, Hardik and his team finally got their smiles back and they do a lap of honour to the kids who have turned up today. Stay tuned for the post-match presentation...</p>",
