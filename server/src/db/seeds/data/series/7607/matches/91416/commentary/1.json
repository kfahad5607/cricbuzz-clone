RR chose to bowl first and their bowlers repaid the faith the captain had in them. Taide departed cheaply and Prabhsimran couldn't get going either. Bairstow played an uncharacteristic knock as he looked sluggish and struggled for rhythm. The Englishman eventually mistimed one against Maharaj and walked off. The RR bowlers kept the pressure on as the spinners took over in the middle overs after the new-ball bowlers. The wicket did hold up and Chahal and Maharaj in particular bowled brilliantly. Wickets kept falling at regular intervals and PBKS couldn't inject any sort of momentum into ther innings in that phase. Jitesh started to play a few expansive shots but couldn't convert his start. Livingstone played a cameo to build some momentum but the real impact came from the Impact player, Ashutosh Sharma. He hit the ball cleanly and took his side close to the 150-run mark. This surface is nowhere near to the surfaces that were used in the last two games here. RR will still fancy themselves but a few wickets upfront can certainly make things interesting. Join us shortly for the run-chase...</p>",
