The 35,000 or so at the stadium are a part of a historic game, a T20 game with the most sixes ever and the most runs scored collectively. Let the margin of defeat not deceive you, because this game was a lot closer till the second strategic time-out. Mumbai Indians got off to a solid start, as Rohit Sharma went on the attack against Jaydev Unadkat, while Kishan took down Bhuvneshwar Kumar from the other end. The openers got to 56 after just 3.2 overs, before Kishan holed out to Shahbaz. Rohit followed him shortly, as he skewed his pull shot against a Pat Cummins bouncer. Mumbai however rebuild with Naman Dhir and Tilak Varma, as the two youngsters played aggressive cricket to keep the asking rate in check. Varma attacked the spinners, scoring sixes for fun to get a fifty. However, the SRH skipper Cummins returned after the time-out, and got the much needed wicket of the southpaw. Hardik and Tim David huffed and puffed after, but SRH's pacers were superb - hiding the ball outside off and offering no pace. The chase never took shape after that, as MI lose their second game as well. Stick around for the presentations.</p>",

(On plans in first innings) You never play for 270, but we wanted to be postive and be aggressive, take the game on. It was a good wicket, so we have to suck it up knowing we would go for a few boundaries. What's important is to have clear plans with the ball.

The message for the batters is simple - go out and express yourself. The plan was to attack, I enjoyed batting with Head, he's one of my favourite batters, I admire him. He told me to go for it if it was in my zone. I'm happy to be getting my chances, doesn't matter what position I'm playing. I had a chance to talk to Brian Lara last night, that helped me massively.
