Punjab Kings, meanwhile, notch up another win on the road. Most of their success this season has come away from home and again today they put on a superb performance to come up trumps. Restricting the Royals to 144 was an excellent effort, even as the pitch was on the slower side. However, the chase wasn't straightforward. In fact, they seemed to be in big trouble at 48/4, but a superb knock from captain Sam Curran led the way as he struck an unbeaten 63 to guide his team to victory with some help from Ashutosh Sharma towards the end. Stay tuned, we'll have the presentations shortly.</p>",

We have to sit back and accept that we are going through failures, have lost four games on the trot. Got to find out what's not working out for us as a team. Somebody needs to step up, we have so many match-winners in the team. This is the time we need to show character. We need to score more runs. We thought 160-170 would have been a good score. We are not used to playing on such wickets this season where 200-plus totals are getting scored easily. We had to play smart cricket and build those partnerships today.
