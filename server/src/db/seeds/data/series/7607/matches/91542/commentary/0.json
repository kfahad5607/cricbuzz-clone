    "commText": "<p><b>Preview</b> by <b>Prakash Govindasreenivasan</b> \\n \\n<b>Lucknow Super Giants</b> must've flown into their home city on Wednesday with a chip on their shoulder and a spring to their step. Not often do you beat <b>CSK in Chennai,</b> matching them phase-for-phase and outplaying them at the death. It's the sort of win that can galvanise a side pushing for the <b>playoffs,</b> but their latest homecoming comes with a tale of caution. It's not just the quality of the opposition arriving on their shores, but the added trickery of the surface where they face-off. \\n \\nLSG, like CSK this year, have been tough to overcome in their home conditions. Except on the one occasion earlier, when <b>Delhi Capitals</b> chased successfully. <b>Rajasthan Royals, who would want to put one foot in the playoffs by the end of Saturday,</b> will have their interest piqued by the fact that the pitch picked for the game is the same as the Delhi fixture - a black soil surface that saw LSG suffer a middle-overs collapse. In the 10 overs after the PowerPlay in that game, LSG got 64/5 and eventually limped to an under-par total. <b>Kuldeep Yadav</b> did the bulk of the damage that day, turning the ball both ways to take out<b> Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran</b> off successive deliveries - the architects of the Chennai thriller. \\n \\nCoincidentally, <b>LSG's assistant coach Sridharan Sriram</b> said on the eve of the game that spinners need to be able to turn the ball both ways to avoid being predictable and be taken for plenty in the middle-overs where batters have continued to power through this season. Over to the likes of <b>R Ashwin and Ravi Bishnoi</b> then, to bring their variations and wrong 'uns to this phase to dictate the direction the game takes. <b>Yuzvendra Chahal</b> too could do with increasing the frequency of googlies, particularly to a batter like <b>Pooran</b> who can hurt them if he makes his way to the death overs. \\n \\nThe middle-overs (overs 7-16) numbers this season so far make for an interesting reading. Between them, <b>RR have struck at a better rate (144.76 to LSG's 138.79) while LSG have been tighter with the ball (Economy rate of 8.23 to RR's 8.92).</b> Brace yourself, then, for an intriguing middle-overs bout. \\n \\n<b>When:</b> Lucknow Super Giants vs Rajasthan Royals, <b>April 27, 2024, 07:30 PM IST</b> \\n \\n<b>Where:</b> Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow \\n \\n<b>What to expect:</b> Not a run-fest? The game on Saturday will be played <b>on one of the four black soil pitches at the venue.</b> It's the surface where LSG needed <b>Ayush Badoni's</b> 35-ball 55 to recover from the precarious position of 94/7 in the defeat to DC. \\n \\n<b>Head to head:</b> RR 3 - 1 LSG. Winners in all of these games batted first. \\n \\n<b>Team Watch</b> \\n \\n<b>Lucknow Super Giants</b> \\n \\n<b>Injuries/Availability:</b> <b>Mayank Yadav</b> bowled at full tilt on the eve of the game. LSG kept their cards close to their chest regarding his availability as <b>Sriram</b> reckoned \"he's pretty close\" to coming back. \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> \\n \\nIf <b>Mayank</b> is ready to be back in the XI, LSG could take one of the two routes - bring him in for <b>Mohsin Khan or Yash Thakur,</b> or go with an all-India pace attack and make room for <b>Kyle Mayers</b> as the fourth-overseas pick in place of a misfiring <b>Devdutt Padikkal.</b> The West Indian is a good match-up option against <b>Yuzvendra Chahal,</b> who he has smashed for <b>23 runs in 10 balls in the IPL.</b> <b>Stoinis</b> batted at #3 and got a century in Chennai but <b>Mayers's</b> inclusion will give them a fiery and flexible 3-4-5 axis (Stoinis-Mayers-Pooran). \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Quinton de Kock, KL Rahul, Devdutt Padikkal/Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran, Deepak Hooda, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, Matt Henry/Mohsin Khan, Yash Thakur <b>[Impact substitute: Mayank Yadav]</b> \\n \\n<b>Rajasthan Royals</b> \\n \\n<b>Injuries/Availability:</b> No injuries to report for the table-toppers \\n \\n<b>Tactics & Matchups:</b> \\n \\n<b>Trent Boult</b> will be licking his lips at the prospect of bowling to some of the LSG batters - <b>Quinton de Kock, Ayush Badoni, Devdutt Padikkal</b> - who have all struggled against left-arm quicks this season. His duel against <b>KL Rahul</b> though, could tilt in the favour of the batter. The LSG captain has scored at <b>168.75 against left-arm pacers this season [108 Runs | 64 balls].</b> Against <b>Boult</b> in the IPL, he has <b>92 runs in 62 balls at 148.4,</b> but has been dismissed twice. <b>Sandeep Sharma</b> meanwhile, has been prolific against both of LSG's openers. <b>Quinton De Kock has 43 runs in 35 balls</b> - and two dismissals - against the pacer while <b>Rahul</b>, who has put concerns regarding his strike rate to rest this season, has scored at only <b>113.1 against him [83 balls | 73 runs | 1 dismissal].</b> \\n \\n<b>Ashwin</b> has been <b>expensive, and wicketless in the last six fixtures</b> but all will be forgotten if he continues his one-upmanship against <b>Stoinis and Pooran.</b> <b>Stoinis</b> has struggled against the offie in IPL, scoring <b>23 off 27 balls</b> and getting dismissed once. <b>Pooran</b> has 25 runs off as many balls and a dismissal. Even <b>Chahal</b> could be the way to go against the <b>Australian,</b> who has been dismissed five times by spinners this season. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Shimron Hetmyer, Rovman Powell, Ravichandran Ashwin, Trent Boult, Avesh Khan, Sandeep Sharma, Yuzvendra Chahal [Impact Substitute: Jos Buttler] \\n \\n<b>Did you know?</b> \\n \\n-<b> Nicholas Pooran</b> has hit nine fours and 11 sixes in the death overs this season [129 runs in 72 balls @ 179.16] \\n \\n-<b> Sanju Samson</b> has scored the bulk of his runs at home this season, and at a good strike rate. Away from home, he has just 42 runs in 3 innings. \\n \\n<b>- Ravi Bishnoi</b> has picked 13 wickets in 11 matches in Lucknow and has maintained an economy rate of just 7.40 \\n \\n<b>What they said:</b> \\n \\n\"I think he's a pretty grounded person. I've worked with him for the last month or so. He seems very mature and knows his body quite well, <b>which is very good for a young, rookie fast bowler. Coming from Delhi,</b> he has got that cricket culture with him that he knows how to look after himself. He's got a good cricketing sense in terms of the areas that he bowls, his execution has been very good. <b>More than the pace that he's provided, it's the execution, and the lengths that he's hit has been the standout for me.The number 155 (kmph)</b> is a by-product of his rhythm, run-up speed and arm speed but the accuracy with which he's bowled is what has stood out. For me that is critical. <b>\" - Sriramon the cynosure of all eyes - Mayank Yadav.</b> \\n \\n\"The benefits are there. He knows about their batters, he would've bowled to them in the nets [last year]. So there is a benefit. At the death, I feel <b>Avesh</b> is bowling the best, he's nailing his <b>yorkers.\"</b> - <b>Dhruv Jurel</b> on the 'benefit' of having former LSG bowler Avesh Khan on his side.</p>",

    "commText": "<p><b>6:20 pm IST</b>: \u200bIt has been a strange IPL, as the season moves towards the business end, the pitches tend to get weary and start to play slow, bringing all kinds of bowling into the equation. But come this year, despite the ongoing heat wave, the scores have kept rattling higher and higher. No other season has seen so many 200+ scores as this season, no other season has seen the bowlers reduced to a mere sideshow than IPL 2024. It's been a run-fest and no bowler has been spared, not even Jasprit Bumrah. A few days back, RCB nearly chased down KKR's 222, a few days later CSK's 210 was made to look inadequate, GT then nearly ran down DC's 224, but the cruellest blow came yesterday night when PBKS razed down KKR's mammoth 261 with 8 balls to spare. The bowlers have become mere sideshows this season and they'll hope that tonight's game in Lucknow doesn't go the same way. The Super Giants are riding high after completing a double over the Chennai Super Kings and they should be confident going into another home game. But they're up against table-toppers, Rajasthan Royals, who have barely put a foot wrong this season. They've a four point cushion at the top of the pile and have one leg in the playoffs, another win tonight and they could all but guarantee a top-2 finish as well. It's 1 v 3 tonight and we should be in for an exciting contest on the cards.</p>",

I execute all my skills at the nets and before the match starts so that I'm well prepared to face the situation during the course\u00a0of the game.

(On his prep) You don\u2019t know the situations that you will get yourself in, so you still have to prepare in a wholistic way on what may happen in the game. Teams have started putting more emphasis on the middle phase. Teams get a lot more runs in the middle phase and not leave a lot for the last five. The thought process is to be aggressive throughout. (On playoffs) We had a talk today about staying in the moment, can\u2019t look too far. We haven\u2019t qualified yet and we know how important it is to finish in the top two. (On his bowling) In the last few games, I whispered in Sanju\u2019s ears saying I can bowl an over or two. When every bowler is getting hit, you try your best to spread the leaks.
