They were off to a slow start, lost Saha in the first over and then Gill struggled to get going, he was dismissed for 19, but Shahrukh Khan was then promoted to number 4, he was sent to take on the spinners and he did so with aplomb. Together with Sai Sudharsan, the Tamil Nadu pair added 45-ball 86-run 3rd wicket stand. He was dismissed but Miller joined Sai and the pair added 69 off 35 balls as GT ended up with a big score. RCB bowled to a plan, they fielded well, but they also conceded a heap of boundaries. They've packed their batting today with Karn Sharma probably batting at 10, but they need to keep winning and the pressure will be on them. Back shortly for the chase..</p>",

The first over spun a bit, the pitch dried up. The wicket is spinning but 200 is a good score. I just had to step out and hit straight. Have been working in the nets with our coaches. Good to play along with him (Sai Sudharsan), we have a good relationship. I think so, 200 is enough. It's important to bowl well and restrict them.</p>",
