Sai and Gill batted was just outstanding, but interestingly, none of the GT batters, including both the set batters couldn't middle the ball at all for the last few balls. There's no real sight of dew. Is it tougher to bat against the older ball? We will have to wait and see. Gill was on a mission - to shut the negativity around him and he put on a mega show. Sai wasn't going great for most parts of PP but picked up big time and matched his captain shot for shot. Those two put on a record stand and made the bowling look absolutely ordinary. Ruturaj didn't believe much in spinners and used up his part-timer and rotated between other bowlers. Didn't help that Gill was put down by Deshpande. Shardul and Deshpande bowled brilliant to keep this around 230. But Chennai did feel the absence of Pathirana and Fizz. Both Gill and Sai made the pitch look flat. If it stays the same, CSK will fancy their chances too. Gill did say he didn't expect dew tonight. If that's the case then it's advantage GT.</p>",
