    "commText": "<p><b>Preview</b> by <b>Vijay Tagore</b> \\n \\nIn the high-stakes life of the <b>IPL,</b> there are no such things as a dead rubber. Each match carries a context, even when the competing teams may seem out of contention for the coveted last four stage. Take, for instance, the regulations set forth by the <b>BCCI</b> which designates a Final League Standing Payment each season for the franchises, which is distributed based on the number of League Points accrued by the teams. \\n \\nAs per the franchise agreement, in possession of <b>Cricbuzz,</b> <b>The League Points are awarded according to the teams' final standings in the points table before the Playoffs. The last-placed team receives one point, and subsequent teams earn one additional point for each position traversing up the table.</b> This system is to make sure fair distribution of funds among franchises based on their performance. \\n \\nBesides the fee share differential, teams are also driven by the desire to evade the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of the table. A victory on Friday will lift Mumbai Indians from the 10th position. Whether they remain in the new spot will be a function of teams around them perform. \\n \\n<b>\"We have to play for our pride...</b> We want to end the season on a high,\" said <b>Naman Dhir</b> on the eve of the game. MI have had a horror season, nothing going well for them except <b>Jasprit Bumrah's</b> bowling and occasional bursts of brilliance from the bat of <b>Suryakumar Yadav.</b> Ahead of the World Cup, there'll also be something to look for, particularly the form of <b>Rohit Sharma and above all skipper Hardik Pandya,</b> who are all in the Indian squad. It could also be of interest to see the reception for the captain if and when when the Mumbai Indians players take a lap of honour. \\n \\n<b>Lance Klusener</b> went a little further than what <b>Naman Dhir</b> said about the game. \"Yeah, I think next year there is a mega auction. There's people that want to impress. I think we're playing for our supporters. We've got a lot to play for tomorrow,\" the LSG's assistant coach said. \\n \\nWhen LSG owner <b>Sanjeev Goenka</b> was seen conversing with skipper <b>KL Rahul</b> in an animated manner after the game in Hyderabad, it was believed to be about how they can win the championship. Now that scenario is out of equation. The Lucknow side is in seventh position and are set to end up in the mid-table. A last four berth is virtually ruled out for them. <b>Goenka and Rahul</b> can now plan only for the next season. That is, of course, only if <b>Goenka retains the captain and Rahul agrees to stay with the team.</b> \\n \\n<b>When:</b> Mumbai Indians vs Lucknow Super Giants, IPL 2024, May 17, 19:30 IST \\n \\n<b>Where:</b> Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai \\n \\n<b>What to expect:</b>The Wankhede Stadium has seen a substantial dip in first-innings scores in night games this season, down to 174 from a high of 200 just 12 months ago. That said, teams will still want to chase. \\n \\n<b>Head to Head:</b> MI 1 - 4 LSG. Mumbai Indians only win against Lucknow was in the Eliminator at the Chepauk last year. \\n \\n<b>Team Watch</b> \\n \\n<b>Mumbai Indians</b> \\n \\n<b>Injury and availability:</b> All players are injury free \\n \\n<b>Tactics and Match-Up:</b> It is possible that <b>Jasprit Bumrah</b> will be rested for the clash. Viewed in isolation of the game, that will be a tactical misstep not only because of Bumrah's reputation as a great of the format. He has favourable matchups against <b>Marcus Stoinis</b> (28 runs in 36 balls, 3 dismissals) and <b>Nicholas Pooran</b> (13 runs in 18 balls, 2 dismissals). \\n \\n<b>Bumrah</b> has also dismissed <b>Rahul</b> twice and the batter has a strike rate of <b>124.8</b> against the MI pacer. However, <b>Piyush Chawla</b> is also a good option against the LSG captain, having dismissed him twice in 20 deliveries for just 33 runs. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> Ishan Kishan (wk), Rohit Sharma, Naman Dhir, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Nehal Wadhera, Tim David, Mohammad Nabi, Gerald Coetzee, Piyush Chawla [Impact Sub: Akash Madhwal] \\n \\n<b>Lucknow Super Giants</b> \\n \\n<b>Injury and Availability:</b> Barring Mayank Yadav, all players are injury free \\n \\n<b>Tactics and Match-Up:</b> <b>Ishan Kishan</b> has been dismissed four times in 30 deliveries by <b>Ravi Bishnoi,</b> making the legspinner a good option for LSG to use early. <b>Bishnoi</b> also has a favourable matchup against <b>Suryakumar Yadav,</b> having accounted for him three times in 32 balls. \\n \\n<b>Probable XI:</b> KL Rahul (c), Quinton de Kock (wk), Marcus Stoinis, Deepak Hooda, Nicholas Pooran, Krunal Pandya, Ayush Badoni, Arshad Khan, Ravi Bishnoi, Naveen-ul-Haq, Yudhvir Singh [Impact Sub: Mohsin Khan] \\n \\n<b>Did you know?</b> \\n \\n- LSG don't have any bowlers in the top 20 of the wicket-takers. Only two of their bowlers have gone past the 10-wicket mark <b>(Naveen 12 & Yash Thakur 11).</b> \\n \\n<b>- KL Rahul</b> has scored 895 runs in 17 innings against Mumbai Indians, with <b>five fifties and three hundreds, and averages 81.36</b> against them. Rahul also has a good record at <b>Wankhede,</b> with 579 runs in 11 innings, including two hundreds and four fifties. \\n \\n- Since IPL 2023, <b>Suryakumar Yadav</b> has scored 577 runs in 12 innings at an average of 64.11 at <b>Wankhede,</b> with two hundreds and five fifties. \\n \\n<b>What they said:</b> \\n \\n\"Sometimes we batted well or sometimes we bowled well. The coaches have also spoken with us that it was not our season, yet we worked hard. Yes, Jasprit bhai did not get enough support to his bowling in some matches, but we will learn from it,\" - <b>Naman Dhir</b> about what went wrong for the side in the season</p>",
