Salt holed out in the very first over and Bumrah bowled a scorching inswinging yorker to get rid of Narine first ball. Shreyas Iyer ended up getting bowled round his legs not too long thereafter and KKR were in strife. That's when Venky Iyer stood up to the task. He made a free-flowing 42 before a nice partnership between Nitish Rana and Andre Russell got KKR back on track. Rinku Singh and Ramandeep Singh made some vital contributions down the order as well as KKR got to 157. It's a total that's probably just on par, should be a riveting chase coming up.</p>",
