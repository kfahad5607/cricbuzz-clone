When we usually have practice sessions, I turn up on the ground early. I used to go early with Surya bhai and we used to play like match simulation, that gave me confidence that although I\u2019m not playing a match, it feels like playing a match in practice.

Rohit fell in the first over trying to be aggressive against Boult. Ishan Kishan chased a wide one to nick off. SKY became Sandeep Sharma's second victim and in the process fell to the latter for the fourth time in IPL. While they were reduced to 20/4 in the reverse fixture, MI were 20/3 today. Nabi got a promotion and looked in good touch but he was nipped out by Chahal who in the process became the first IPL player to pick 200 wickets. At 52/4, Mumbai were in a spot of bother; that's when Tilak Varma and Nehal Wadhera joined hands. Not only did the two youngsters stabilise the innings by counterattacking, they also put MI in a very good position (151/4 after 16 overs). Wadhera, playing his first match of the season, fell for 49 and RR came back strongly in the death overs. <b>Last 4 overs: 28 runs | 5 wickets.</b> While Avesh Khan nailed the yorkers in the penultimate power, Sandeep bowled outside the batters' hitting zone to pick up three wickets in the 20th over and claim a fifer in his comeback match.</p>",
