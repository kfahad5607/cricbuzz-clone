Only a few days ago they chased down 195-plus against Royal Challengers Bangalore. Coming back to this game, the ploy to move Rahane up the order didn't work for CSK as Coetzee got his wicket within the powerplay. Ravindra too couldn't continue for long as he was dismissed by Shreyas Gopal in the 8th over. Just when MI had things under control, Dube and Gaikwad joined hands and had a fantastic partnership for the third wicket. Both the batters played some exquisite shots in their partnership and also notched up their fifties in the process. Shreyas Gopal bowled the only over due to Dube's threat, however, Shepherd was at the receiving end of some pyrotechnics instead. Bumrah bowled a couple of wily overs towards the end to restrict Mitchell, but Dhoni walked out to bat and hit a hat-trick of sixes in the final over of the innings. That was an icing on the cake. Back in 10 minutes for the second essay...</p>",
