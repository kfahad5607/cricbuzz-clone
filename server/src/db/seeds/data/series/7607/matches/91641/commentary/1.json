There are two ways to sum up this innings; the first period when Rahul struggled to get going and the second where Badoni and Pooran showed batting was not that difficult. Lucknow will hope it is the former and that the surface remains the same way. Quinton de Kock and Stoinis fell cheaply, Rahul, barring the six off Cummins, could not get the ball past the 30-yard circle and Krunal got himself in but threw it away via a run-out. The Super Giants were reeling at 66/4 in 11.2 overs when the pair got together. They showed intent right from the start and stitched a crucial 99-run partnership. Badoni got to his fifty while Pooran was denied his by a superb Nitish effort. This looks like a competitive total if the conditions don't change. Back soon with the chase..</p>",

It's not a wicket where you can go from ball 1. The bowlers were bowling short slower balls, so I was looking to find the gap on the shorter square. It's a good score if the dew doesn't come, I think our bowlers will defend it. As of now, there's no dew.</p>",

The floodlights for some reasons had turned off. A few of them I guess had gone off. It is coming back on now. Hence, the delay.An offie to start.</p>",
