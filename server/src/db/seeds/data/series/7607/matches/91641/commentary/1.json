Lucknow will hope it is the former and that the surface remains the same way. Quinton de Kock and Stoinis fell cheaply, Rahul, barring the six off Cummins, could not get the ball past the 30-yard circle and Krunal got himself in but threw it away via a run-out. The Super Giants were reeling at 66/4 in 11.2 overs when the pair got together. They showed intent right from the start and stitched a crucial 99-run partnership. Badoni got to his fifty while Pooran was denied his by a superb Nitish effort. This looks like a competitive total if the conditions don't change. Back soon with the chase..</p>",
