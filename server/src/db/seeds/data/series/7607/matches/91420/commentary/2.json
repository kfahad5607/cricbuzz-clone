When we got wickets, it gave us the advantage to come in and put an attacking effort. Character and attitude bowlers showed was exceptional. Will keep reiterating that it's a funny tournament and have to stay in the present as much as possible. Have to seize the moment and not leave it on someone else.</p>",

Their middle order, with the exception of Pooran, looks very vulnerable and out of touch. Their bowling hasn't been much better either. As for KKR, they've bounced back nicely after the defeat at Chepauk to make it four wins in five games. That's all from us here. The big game between MI and CSK is about to get underway, so quickly hop tabs to catch all the action.
