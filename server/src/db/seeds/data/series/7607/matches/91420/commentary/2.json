In contrast, KKR were right on the money earlier in the afternoon. Mitchell Starc was good with new ball, and also at the death, while Sunil Narine bowled another brilliant spell of 1/17, building up so much pressure on a timid LSG lineup. The pitch was on the slower side in the afternoon, but there wasn't enough intent to score quickly either, again leaving Pooran with too much to do.

He needs to work on consistency in line and length, obviously got the ball to swing and seam around in the powerplay.

Some games it happens, some times it doesn't, but once you're in some control, it becomes easier. 2 out of 2 (on the wins at home), the boys are keen and everyone are enjoying it. Once you enjoy, you'll have some fun. Probably the figures don't show, he was unlucky (on Shamar Joseph), he bowled 4 overs, he kept going, showed some energy and that's a positive. He's played well in every game (on Phil Salt), has shown some fine form and hopefully he'll keep going and get some big runs. I will be watching it from home, Badree (when asked if he would want to come back for the T20 World Cup).</p>",
