They got nowhere close the other day against RCB, and have lost by a massive 78 runs here at Chepauk. CSK will be chuffed with this performance as their bowlers were absolutely remarkable despite there being so much dew on the outfield. They used the reasonably sized square boundaries quite well, especially Deshpande upfront with the new ball as he got both Head and Abhishek caught at deep point. He ended up finishing with his best figures in IPL - going on to take a four-fer, while Pathirana was brilliant again in the middle overs. The execution of plans from the CSK pacers to bowl wide of off after the powerplay, and a brilliant spell of 1/22 from Jadeja, meant that SRH were left deprived of boundaries with even someone like Klaasen struggling to get going. Eventually, most of their batters ended up getting caught in the deep while going for the big shot. They kept finding Mitchell at the boundary, giving him as many as five catches and he held onto every one of those.</p>",

Today we were outstanding in the field. Stuck to the plans and knew what the conditions were. With impact player rule, you always want the extra 20 runs. Never know what par score is. That was one area - not getting wickets in powerplay. That's the only way it can put opposition in back foot. He's bowling really well (Deshpande). His hard work is paying off. Special mention to Jaddu as well. In these wet conditions to go for 22 runs, that was the match turning spell. I'm not vocal. Can't tell seniors in the dressing room what to do.
