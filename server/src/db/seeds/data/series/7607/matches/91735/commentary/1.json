Boult did the damage in the powerplay by picking up three wickets but Tripathi's 15-ball 37 ensured that Hyderabad got off to a flying start. The game slowed down as the field spread and the ball got older. The bowlers found bowling into the pitch and taking pace off was the way to go. Avesh and Sandeep were brilliant at that as they didn't Klaasen to get on with things. The keeper-batter curbed his natural game and got to a fifty but was dismissed in the penultimate over. Only 12 runs came off the last two overs and that might be a telling factor. But SRH have got a blueprint as to how to bowl on this wicket and that will make the chase interesting. Back soon..</p>",

The last two wickets we played on have probably been the best two of the whole tournament which is great for this time of the tournament. We hung in there nicely as a group and the way we finished at the death along with the spinners in the middle, we have restricted them to a nice total. Those guys (Avesh and Sandeep) have been doing an amazing job, adapting to whatever surface we have come up against. Avesh has been bowling beautifully for us the whole tournament.
