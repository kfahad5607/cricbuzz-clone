The groundstaff still used the ropes to ensure the outfield is completely dry. The powerplay is going to be crucial as the new ball will come on. SRH have a huddle before taking the field. Jaiswal and TKC stride out to the middle. Bhuvi has the new ball. There's one slip in place. We are ready to go..</p>",

There was a mixture of boundaries and a mixture of wickets, which is a little bit unusual. We took wickets throughout the whole game and that restricted them to a score that we are pretty confident about. You always try to be aggressive, the hardest thing is to adapt to the wicket. The last two wickets we played on have probably been the best two of the whole tournament which is great for this time of the tournament. We hung in there nicely as a group and the way we finished at the death along with the spinners in the middle, we have restricted them to a nice total. Those guys (Avesh and Sandeep) have been doing an amazing job, adapting to whatever surface we have come up against. Avesh has been bowling beautifully for us the whole tournament. Sandy (Sandeep) is a very experienced bowler and he showed his skill tonight. Only half the job done, we are looking forward to the chase.</p>",

The game slowed down as the field spread and the ball got older. The bowlers found bowling into the pitch and taking pace off was the way to go. Avesh and Sandeep were brilliant at that as they didn't Klaasen to get on with things. The keeper-batter curbed his natural game and got to a fifty but was dismissed in the penultimate over.
