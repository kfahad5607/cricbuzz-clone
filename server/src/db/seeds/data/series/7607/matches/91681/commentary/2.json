Only if they had Pant for the last game and they could have performed better. Things might have been a little different for them. LSG needed 209 for a win and they were never in the chase. They lost four in the powerplay and that kind of dented them in the chase. Pooran then sparkled like he has in the entire season and scored 61 off 27 balls. His dismissal would have meant it was all over for LSG but they unearthed a new talent in the form of Arshad Khan. His 58 off 33 balls kept LSG in the game even till the 19th over. But DC just about held their nerves to clinch it. A loss here might have just closed the road for LSG. They would be gutted. Their NRR took a beating in the game against SRH and now this loss.
