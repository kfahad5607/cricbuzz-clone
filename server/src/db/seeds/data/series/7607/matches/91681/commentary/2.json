They lost four in the powerplay and that kind of dented them in the chase. Pooran then sparkled like he has in the entire season and scored 61 off 27 balls. His dismissal would have meant it was all over for LSG but they unearthed a new talent in the form of Arshad Khan. His 58 off 33 balls kept LSG in the game even till the 19th over. But DC just about held their nerves to clinch it. A loss here might have just closed the road for LSG. They would be gutted. Their NRR took a beating in the game against SRH and now this loss.

I would say the start of the season was with a lot of hopes. Some injuries. We are still in contention even after the last game. We had a better chance of qualifying if I would have had a chance to play in the last game. Personally, it was fantastic to come back. Was heartening to see the support from entire India. Was a long time to wait after one-and-a-half years. I want to be on the field all the time. Don't want to miss any action.</p>",
