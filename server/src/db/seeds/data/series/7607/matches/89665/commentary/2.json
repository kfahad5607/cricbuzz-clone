And their bowlers are holding their nerve to eke out wins out of nervy situations. Simpler times, weren't they? This game shouldn't have gotten so close after KKR made 208 thanks to a fiery knock from Dre Russ, sprinkled with a Salt fifty that charred out Cummins' SRH. The visitors started brightly, as Agarwal and Abhishek Sharma both got starts, but both fell after scoring 32 runs. The KKR spinners choked the batters in the middle phase, as Narine escaped without conceding a boundary in his whole spell, while picking the wicket of Rahul Tripathi. It was looking like a routine win, but Heinrich Klaasen gave the hosts some worries as he took down Chakaravarthy's final over for 21 runs. Klaasen and Shahbaz then attacked Starc, smoking him for 26 runs in the penultimate over. Needing 60 off the final three overs, SRH got the equation down to 13 off the last one, but Harshit Rana held his own to give KKR two points in this thriller. Stick on for the presentations.</p>",

    "commText": "<p><b>Shreyas Iyer:</b> Right from the 17th over, had butterflies in my stomach. Felt anything could happen in the last over. They needed 13 runs and we didn't have the most experienced bowler. But I had the belief in him, and I told him to back himself and it doesn't matter what happens. He was a bit nervous coming in, and I just looked him in the eye and told him 'this is your moment, buddy.' Told him to back himself and doesn't matter what happens in the game. (On Russell and Narine) They have such experience. Great to see Andre perform with bat and ball, and even Sunny (Narine) was splendid with the ball. Fantastic to have them around. Always gives you motivation when you start with a win. This game also gives us a lot of learnings, there is a lot we will take from this ground. I think fielding is an area we need to improve on. It was so loud out there, it was difficult to signal to the other players from the deep.</p>",

(On his journey with KKR) I was on the bench early on, and just tried to make myself useful. This franchise means a lot to me, what I did tonight was just a way to prove what this jersey means to me. Hopefully I can keep performing this way. (On Harshit Rana) Shows a lot about his character.
