And their bowlers are holding their nerve to eke out wins out of nervy situations. Simpler times, weren't they? This game shouldn't have gotten so close after KKR made 208 thanks to a fiery knock from Dre Russ, sprinkled with a Salt fifty that charred out Cummins' SRH. The visitors started brightly, as Agarwal and Abhishek Sharma both got starts, but both fell after scoring 32 runs. The KKR spinners choked the batters in the middle phase, as Narine escaped without conceding a boundary in his whole spell, while picking the wicket of Rahul Tripathi. It was looking like a routine win, but Heinrich Klaasen gave the hosts some worries as he took down Chakaravarthy's final over for 21 runs. Klaasen and Shahbaz then attacked Starc, smoking him for 26 runs in the penultimate over. Needing 60 off the final three overs, SRH got the equation down to 13 off the last one, but Harshit Rana held his own to give KKR two points in this thriller. Stick on for the presentations.</p>",

Many might call that as snooty and borderline crass, but perhaps it is that brash attitude which gives someone the self confidence to defend 13 runs in a final over against a charged up Heinrich Klaasen, after getting hit for six first up. He is a Delhi boy after all, and given the track record of what \u2018arrogant\u2019, self confident Delhi boys can conjure up on the cricket field, we'd say keep it coming, Harshit! Another home win in the IPL, a winning start for a returning Shreyas Iyer and Gautam Gambhir. That\u2019s all for now, time to blow a flying kiss and call it a night.
